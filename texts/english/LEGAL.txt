PREFACE 

THE Institute standard course of study in "Commercia:i 
Law" is not intended to make lawyers, but simply to 
impart to bankers sufficient knowledge of law to enable 
them to act in accordance with established legal principles, 
and refer doubtful questions to a lawyer. It is not usurping 
the functions of a lawyer for a banker to know his legal rights 
and responsibilities. The banker who does not appreciate the 
importance of this knowledge, eventually learns from, experi- 
ence, sad or otherwise, that he has neglected an important 
part of the training necessary to carry on his business with 
safety and confidence. This text-book is based on the splendid 
work, originally prepared for the Institute, by Samuel Willis- 
ton, Weld Professor of Law in Harvard Law School. To this 
original matter, however, much new material has been added, 
cases have been cited, and new chapters on Master and Ser- 
vant, Estates and Trusts, Bills and Notes, and Torts and 
Crimes added. The work of preparing "Commercial Law" 
has been done jointly by Richard D. Currier, President of the 
New Jersey Law School, and Richard W. Hill, member of the 
New York Bar and Secretary of the American Institute of 
Banking. The main purpose of this book is to teach bankers 
to recognize the danger signals in law, when they appear, and 
thus be able to distinguish between law and law suits.

INSTITUTE PLATFORM 



RESOLUTION adopted at the New Orleans Convention 
of the American Institute of Banking, October 9, 1919: 
"Ours is an educational association organized for 
the benefit of the banking fraternity of the country and within 
our membership may be found on an equal basis both em- 
ployees and employers; and in full appreciation of the oppor- 
tunities which our country and its established institutions 
afford, and especially in appreciation of the fact that the 
profession of banking affords to its diligent and loyal members 
especial opportunities for promotion to official and managerial 
positions, and that as a result of the establishment and main- 
tenance of the merit system in most banks a large number 
of Institute members have through individual application 
achieved marked professional success, we at all times and 
under all circumstances stand for the merit system and for 
the paying of salaries according to the value of the service 
rendered. 

"We believe in the equitable cooperation of employees 
and employers and are opposed to all attempts to limit indi- 
vidual initiative and curtail production, and, insofar as our 
profession is concerned, are unalterably opposed to any plan 
purporting to promote the material welfare of our members, 
individually or collectively, on any other basis than that of 
efficiency, loyalty and unadulterated Americanism."

WHO IS A BANKER? 



A SUCCESSFUL BANKER is 
composed of about one-fifth 
accountant, two-fifths lawyer, three- 
fifths political economist, and four- 
fifths gentleman and scholar â€” total 
ten-fifths â€” double size. Any smaller 
person may be a pawnbroker or 
a promoter, but not a banker. â€” 
George E. Allen. 



Commercial Law 



INTRODUCTION 

DEFINITION OF LAW.â€” The term "law" is 
used in many ways. We speak of moral law, 
law of gravity, divine law, and the like. In each 
case we are making proper use of the term, but in no 
instance are we using it as we shall use it in this book. 
To illustrate : You find a beggar on your front porch 
when entering your house late at night. Suppose he 
should ask you for food and lodging for the night. 
Although there is no other house within five miles of 
your home, you refuse to take him in, or do anything 
for him. As a result he contracts pneumonia from 
exposure, because he is not able to proceed further. 
You would, nevertheless, not be liable in the sense in 
which we are using the term "law." But, you say, in 
an extreme case of this kind, it is one's duty to act. 
We grant it, but to be accurate, you must preface your 
proposition with the statement, "under the moral law" 
or "under divine law it is one's duty to act in such a 
case." However much it is to be regretted that moral or 
divine law sometimes does not harmonize with "law" 
as we shall treat it, we must, nevertheless, recognize 
that fact. Law, as viewed by the jurist, and this is the 
way we, as students, are to consider it, is defined by 
Blackstone to be "A rule of civil conduct prescribed 
by the supreme power in the State, commanding what 
is right, and prohibiting what is wrong." Referring 

7 



8 COMMERCIAL LAW 

again to our illustration, is it not easy to see that it 
would be impracticable in the present condition of so- 
ciety for the legislature of California, for example, 
to pass a law which should, in that State, constitute 
"a rule of civil conduct" commanding that every one 
"shall be his brother's keeper" and for a violation 
thereof "shall be imprisoned for one year, or fined one 
thousand dollars, or both." However much we recog- 
nize the obligation of moral law, jurists and legislators 
cannot ignore the fact that society is composed of ordi- 
nary human beings, still far from perfection. Assum- 
ing, although perhaps it is doubtful, that it is within 
the power of the legislature of California to pass such 
an act as has been suggested, there are not courts 
enough in the whole United States to decide the cases 
which would arise in New York City alone in attempt- 
ing to apply the provisions of such an act. On second 
thought, then, it is not such a startling proposition 
for us to learn that "law" is not synonymous 
with the same term when used in referring to natural 
law, moral law, and the like. Much has been written 
on the essential nature of "law" as we shall use the 
term. The time-honored definition of Blackstone, 
which we have quoted, is confessedly imperfect. The 
last clause, "commanding what is RIGHT, and pro- 
hibiting what is WRONG" has been much criticized, 
and Mr. Chitty has modified it to "commanding what 
shall be done, and what shall not be done." Today, 
to attempt to buy a bottle of light wine at a hotel does 
not seem to many of us intrinsically WRONG, but 
legally, under existing laws, it is, and so perhaps Mr. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 9 

Chitty's modification of Blackstone's definition dees 
bring out the correct idea more clearly. For our 
purpose, these two definitions are sufficient. 

THE SYSTEMS OF LAW.â€” There are two 
chief systems of law in use among civilized peoples 
today, the Roman or civil law, and, the English or 
common law. The Roman, or civil law (Roman law is 
spoken of as civil law, from the Latin *'civilis," belong- 
ing to a citizen) as its name implies, originated in 
Rome. As the city of Rome developed into the Roman 
Empire, its law became that of the ancient world. It 
was finally codified by the Roman Emperor Justinian, 
in the year 530 A.D., and was eventually absorbed, 
from the twelfth to the eighteenth century, into the 
law of modern Europe. It is the basis of the systems 
of law used in the countries of continental Europe, 
Central and South America, and all French, Spanish, 
Portuguese, and Dutch colonies or countries settled 
by those peoples. 

COMMON LAW.â€” The common law had its 
roots in the customary law of the Germanic peoples 
of western Europe, and was developed by the English 
courts from the thirteenth to the nineteenth centuries. 
Like the Roman law, it has spread all over the world 
wherever English-speaking peoples have settled, and 
founded colonies. The common law now prevails in 
England, Canada (except Quebec), India, except over 
Hindus and Mohammedans in certain instances, and 
the principal British colonies, except those in South 
Africa. The United States is largely an English set- 
tlement, hence the common law prevails with us, 



10 COMMERCIAL LAW 

except in the State of Louisiana, where the influence 
of the French and Spanish settlements still remains 
and makes the basis of the Louisiana law the Roman 
law, and in the Philippines and Porto Rico, where the 
law was Roman when we took those possessions from 
Spain in 1898. 

THE SOURCE OF LAW.â€” Where does this rule 
of civil conduct we are to study come from? At first 
blush, the superficial observer might suggest some 
legislative hall where it is created by a legislative body, 
a perfect product, to be imposed on men and women 
as the guide in their every act in civil life. The slight- 
est reference to historical jurisprudence will convince 
us that this is not the true source of the law. Mr. Jus- 
tice Holmes of the United States Supreme Court, in 
his classic, "The Common Law," indicates the real 
source of law when he observes : "The life of the law 
has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt 
necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and polit- 
ical theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or 
unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share 
with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more to 
do than the syllogism in determining the rules by 
which men should be governed. The law embodies the 
story of a nation's development through many centu- 
ries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only 
the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics. 
In order to know what it is, we must know what it has 
been, and what it tends to become. We must alter- 
nately consult history and existing theories of legisla- 
tion. But the most difficult labor will be to understand 



COMMERCIAL LAW 11 

the combination of the two into new products at every 
stage. The substance of the law at any given time 
pretty nearly corresponds, so far as it goes, with what 
is then understood to be convenient ; but its form and 
machinery, and the degree to which it is able to work 
out desired results, depend very much upon its past." 

WHERE TO LOOK FOR LAW.â€” Knowing the 
source of law does not necessarily tell us where to look 
for the law. Today, in the United States, we have 
three primary sources to which the lawyer goes to 
seek the law on any particular point. First, the Consti- 
tution of the United States and the Constitution of 
the State in which he is to ascertain the law, including 
the statutes which have been enacted by Congress and 
by the State legislature under those constitutions. Sec- 
ond, the decisions of the courts, particularly those of 
the United States courts and of the State where he 
wishes to learn the law, and, if need be, the decisions 
of other States. Third, text-books and treatises on the 
branch of law to be investigated. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” Let us suppose you wish to 
ascertain the law concerning a question that comes up 
in your own daily life. Take two problems. First : We 
will assume you keep a clothing store, and an infant, 
twenty years old, purchases a suit of winter clothes. 
His income is $1000 per year. He already has two 
perfectly good winter suits. A week after purchasing 
this suit, he returns it and demands his money back. 
You wish to know whether you have to give it to him. 
If you should look in the Constitution of the United 
States, or of the State of Vermont (assuming this to 



12 COMMERCIAL LAW 

be a Vermont contract), you would find nothing that 
would give you any help in answering this question. 
If you should look through all of the acts of Congress 
and the laws passed by the legislature of the State of 
Vermont, you would find nothing to give you any 
help. If, however, you should look in the decisions of 
the courts, both of the United States and of the State 
of Vermont, you would find cases, probably many of 
them, covering this particular situation, and you 
would find the rule to be laid down as law, that an 
infant (and by an infant we mean anyone under 
twenty-one years) is not liable on his contracts, except 
for necessities, and then only in a quasi-contractual 
action for their reasonable value. Applying the law to 
the problem, you would be obliged to admit the legal- 
ity of the infant's claim, and if you did not refund the 
money to him, he would be entitled to sue for it in a 
court. Three winter suits are clearly not necessaries 
at one time for an infant with an income no greater 
than $1000 per year. This is a comparatively simple 
problem. Now let us take another case somewhat 
more difficult. You live in New Jersey near the plant 
of an airplane manufacturing company. Machines are 
constantly being tried out, and they circle over your 
premises within four or five hundred feet from the 
ground. You have several children who are using your 
back yard as a playground and you are much alarmed, 
fearing that an airplane may fall in the yard and kill 
or injure a child. You wish to ascertain your rights. 
You look in the Constitution of the United States, and 
of the State of New Jersey. You will find nothing in 



COMMERCIAL LAW 13 

either about airplanes. You look in the acts of Con- 
gress and the laws of the legislature of the State of 
New Jersey. You will find nothing there to help you. 
You look in the decisions of the courts, both of the 
United States and of the State of New Jersey. You 
will find nothing there. You look in the text-books, 
and, except in the most recent, in all probability you 
will find nothing there in regard to airplanes. You 
may search the recent legal publications and you will 
find articles discussing in a purely theoretical way this 
interesting topic. You study recent legislation and 
you v/ill find stray instances of attempts to deal with 
aerial matters. For example, Connecticut has a statute 
on airplanes. In fact, your whole search will be most 
interesting. All you will find, however, is not law in 
New Jersey, but is simply theory, based on common 
law principles or statutes having no force in New Jer- 
sey. Should you then conclude that you have no rights, 
that the law cannot help you? Perhaps not. If you 
turn to treatises relating to the ownership of land as 
developed in the English common law and as applied 
by the courts in the United States, you will find that 
the word *'land" is often used as practically synony- 
mous with realty or ground or soil, and you will also 
find that it includes everything attached to the realty 
or growing on it. As is commonly said, land has an 
indefinite extent upward as well as downward, the old 
books using the Latin maxim: "Cuius est solum, eius 
est usque ad coelum usque ad orcum." (To whomso- 
ever the soil belongs, he owns also to the sky and to 
the depths.) 



14 COMMERCIAL LAW 

There are three houses in a row on Smith 
Street, Nos. 1, 3 and 5. Mary Jones lives in No. 1, and 
Sarah Green in No. 5. They are friends, and accor- 
dingly arrange to stretch their clotheslines from their 
rear second-story windows across the back yard of 
No. 3. Under common law principles, this is a trespass 
upon No. 3. Should Mary Jones and Sarah Green con- 
tinue to do this for the required time, usually twenty 
years, they would acquire by prescription a permanent 
right to stretch clotheslines over lot No. 3. When the 
owner of lot No. 3 wished to erect a ten-story building 
covering all of his lot, he would be seriously interfered 
v/ith by the right acquired by his two adjoining neigh- 
bors. He could have protected himself by proper 
action in a court when the offense was first committed. 
Could not, therefore, the court take this principle of 
the common law as to the ownership of land and apply 
it to the airplane case? If the owner of lot No. 3 could 
prevent the owners of lots Nos. 1 and 5 from stretch- 
ing clotheslines across his land, could you not prevent 
the airplane from crossing your land, although it is 
five hundred feet above the surface of the soil? Twenty 
years' continuation of that practice would interfere 
with your ability to build a Woolworth building 
twenty-five years from now should you desire to do so. 
It is simply taking an old principle of law recognized 
for centuries, and applying it to new conditions. This 
is what we mean when we say that the principles of 
common law are capable of indefinite expansion ; that 
the common law is always growing, or, as Mr. Justice 
Holmes puts it, it is the product of "the felt necessi- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 15 

ties of the time." As soon, however, as you have se- 
cured an injunction from the court preventing the 
airplane factory from practicing its machines over 
your land, all of the other property owners in the 
neighborhood of the factory decide to protect their 
rights, with the result that no airplane can leave the 
factory through the air. Does this mean that the 
airplane factory must move, and probably be sub- 
jected to the same annoyances in its new location in 
a short time? We are coming to realize that airplanes 
are necessities. When a necessity and a principle 
of law cannot exist side by side, something must 
be done to remedy an intolerable situation. The 
illustration here used presents what in the course 
of a few years, undoubtedly, will become an intol- 
erable situation, unless remedied in some way. It 
has been suggested that we must modify our principles 
of the ownership of land, and give airplanes the right 
of free passage over the land of any person, when a 
certain distance in the air, far enough up to cause no 
great amount of danger or annoyance. Such a change 
in the law would have to be accomplished by the State 
legislature or by an act of Congress for such territory 
as Congress has jurisdiction over. No doubt, legisla- 
tion along such lines may be expected soon. It will be 
simply a repetition of a situation created by a leading 
case in New York in 1902. 

In Roberson v. The Rochester Folding Box 
Company, 171 New York 538, the suit was 
brought on behalf of a living person, a young 
lady, to restrain a flour company from putting her 



16 COMMERCIAL LAW 

likeness upon prints advertising its flour. Mr. Justice 
Parker, writing the opinion of the court, held that 
there was no principle of law which would author- 
ize the court to issue an injunction restraining this 
unauthorized use of a photograph. This created the 
unfortunate situation in the State of New York of 
allowing anyone to make use of another's photograph 
without that person's consent, for advertising or other 
purposes. The court, in its opinion, admitted the un- 
fortunateness of the situation, observing that "The 
legislative body could very well interfere and arbitra- 
rily provide that no one should be permitted for his 
own selfish purpose to use the picture or the name 
of another for advertising purposes without his con- 
sent. In such event no embarrassment would result 
to the general body of the law, for the rule would be 
applicable only to cases provided for by statute. The 
courts however, being without authority to legislate, 
are required to decide cases upon principle, and so 
are necessarily embarrassed by precedents created by 
an extreme, and therefore unjustifiable application of 
an old principle. The court below properly said that : 
'While it may be true that the fact that no precedent 
can be found to sustain an action in any given case is 
cogent evidence that a principle does not exist upon 
which the right may be based, it is not the rule that 
the want of a precedent is a sufficient reason for turn- 
ing the plaintiff out of court,' provided (I think should 
be added)," Mr. Justice Parker continues, "there can 
be found a clear and unequivocal principle of the com- 
mon law, which either directly or mediately governs 



COMMERCIAL LAW 17 

it, or which, by analogy or parity of reasoning, ought 
to govern it." ReHef was denied the young lady. The 
following session of the legislature corrected the evil 
by passing a law making it a criminal offense to use 
another's photograph without that person's consent. 
This has been a long illustration. It has served its 
purpose best if it has left the very distinct impression 
that the law is a vital, living, growing thing. True, 
its roots are in the dim past, but it lives, and moves, 
and has its being in the problems of today. In no field 
of law is this more true than in our subject. Commer- 
cial Law. 

WHO KNOWS THE LAW.â€” The layman is 
frequently of the opinion that a lawyer ought to be 
able to give him a definite answer as to just what the 
law is in a given set of facts. Why is it not possible 
to go to the sources which we have" been discussing 
and from them ascertain definitely what the law is in 
a given case? Frequently the lawyer can do this, but 
one should not lose respect for the lawyer because 
he is not, in many cases, willing to give a definite 
answer, but may frame his reply in an opinion begin- 
ning "It would seem that the law in this case would 
be, etc. â€” " We have already suggested some of the 
difficulties that in part answer the question we now 
ask. Let us take one more illustration, a striking ex- 
ample from the United States Supreme Court. Few 
would question the statement that that Court is the 
highest type of judicial body in the world today. We 
are familiar with the rent profiteering legislation en- 
acted in the District of Columbia, New York and at 



18 COMMERCIAL LAW 

least five other States, as a result of the house shortage 
created by the world war. The United States Supreme 
Court, in the cases of Block v. Hirsh, 254 U. S. 531 
and Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman et al., 
254 U. S. 539, held the New York and the District of 
Columbia rent profiteering laws to be constitutional, 
but this decision is by a vote of five to four, and the 
arguments advanced in the two opinions, one by Mr. 
Justice Holmes, representing the majority of the court, 
and the other by Mr. Justice McKenna, are striking 
examples of how strongly the ablest body of jurists 
in the United States can differ on a legal question. 
Speaking for the majority in Block v. Hirsh, Mr. Jus- 
tice Holmes says: "The main point against the law 
is that tenants are allowed to remain in possession at 
the same rent that they have been paying, unless mod- 
ified by the commission established by the act, and 
that thus the use of the land and the right of the owner 
to do what he will with his own and to make what 
contracts he pleases are cut down. But if the public 
interest be established, the regulation of rates is one 
of the first forms in which it is asserted, and the valid- 
ity of such regulation has been settled since Munn v. 
Illinois, 94 U. S. 113. It is said that a grain elevator 
may go out of business, whereas here the use is fas- 
tened upon the land. The power to go out of business, 
when it exists, is an illusory answer to gas companies 
and waterworks, but we need not stop at that. The 
regulation is put and justified only as a temporary 
measure. * * * A limit in time, to tide over a passing 
trouble, well may justify a law that could not be up- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 19 

held as a permanent change." In the case of Marcus 
Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, involving a similar 
New York law, Mr. Justice Holmes says : "The chief 
objections to these acts have been dealt with in Block 
V. Hirsh, supra. In the present case more emphasis is 
laid upon the impairment of the obligation of the con- 
tract of the lessees to surrender possession, and of the 
new lease, which was to have gone into effect upon 
October 1, last year. But contracts are made subject 
to this exercise of the power of the State when other- 
wise justified, as we have held this to be." Mr. Justice â€¢ 
McKenna, in writing the dissenting opinion in Block 
v. Hirsh, supra, and with whom the late Chief Justice 
White, and Justices Van Devanter and McReynolds 
concurred, says: "If such exercise of government be 
legal, what exercise of government is illegal? Houses 
are a necessary of life, but other things are as neces- 
sary. May they, too, be taken from the direction of 
their owners and disposed of by the Government? 
* * * An affirmative answer seems to be the require- 
ment of the decision. If the public interest may be con- 
cerned, as in the statute under review, with the control 
of any form of property, it can be concerned with 
the control of all forms of property. And, certainly, 
in the first instance, the necessity or expediency of 
control must be a matter of legislative judgment. * * * 
The facts are significant and suggest this inquiry: 
Have conditions come not only to the District of 
Columbia, embarrassing the Federal government, but 
to the world as well, that are not amenable to pass- 
ing palliatives, and that socialism, or some form of 



20 COMMERCIAL LAW 

socialism, is the only permanent corrective or accom- 
modation? It is indeed strange that this court, in 
effect, is called upon to make way for it, and through 
an instrument of a constitution based on personal 
rights and the purposeful encouragement of indi- 
vidual incentive and energy, to declare legal a power 
exerted for their destruction. The inquiry occurs, 
have we come to the realization of the observation 
that 'War, unless it be fought for liberty, is the most 
deadly enemy of liberty.' " 

In the Marcus Brown Holding Co. case, he again 
says for the same justices: "We are not disposed to 
further enlarge upon the case, or attempt to reconcile 
the explicit declaration of the Constitution against the 
power of the state to impair the obligations of a con- 
tract, or, under any pretense, to disregard the declara- 
tion. It is safer, saner, and more consonant with 
constitutional pre-eminence and its purposes, to 
regard the declaration of the Constitution as para- 
mount, and not to weaken it by refined dialectics, or 
bend it to some impulse of emergency because of 
some accident of immediate overwhelming interest 
which appeals to the feelings and distorts the judg- 
ment.' " No more striking illustration of the most 
decided differences of opinion among nine of the ablest 
jurists in the world can be found. It is no wonder then 
that a lawyer at times hesitates in giving an opinion as 
to what the law may be. 

THE FUNCTION OF THE COURT.â€” An 
infant bought a motorcycle on an instalment contract 
at the agreed price of $325. He made an initial pay- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 21 

merit of $125, used the machine a month, damaged it 
to the amount of $156.25, and then returned it in this 
condition and demanded the return of his $125. These 
are the facts in the case of Petit v. Liston, 97 Oregon 
464, a case decided in the Supreme Court of Ore- 
gon. The case involves the right of an infant to dis- 
affirm a contract made by him, when purchasing an 
article which is not a necessity. The Oregon court 
had never before been called on to determine what 
the law in Oregon was as applied to such a situation. 
According to the rule in New York, as laid down in 
Rice V. Butler, 160 N. Y. 578, the infant could not 
recover the $125, but according to the rule in Pyne v. 
Wood, 145 Mass. 558, the infant would be entitled to 
his money. It thus became the problem of the Oregon 
court to refer to the theories back of these two deci- 
sions. After doing so, it approved of the New York 
view, rather than the Massachusetts view. This case 
indicates the function of a court. If a court, from the 
various sources of law which we have enumerated, can 
find an exact precedent for the case before it, or can 
find a general principle of law which can be applied, 
it renders a decision as to the law, as the Oregon court 
did. If no law can be found nor any principles which 
can be applied, the court is forced to deny the relief, 
as in the Roberson case, 171 N. Y. 538, adding, per- 
haps, to its opinion, as it did in that case, the sugges- 
tion that it is a matter Congress or a State legislature 
might properly remedy. 

THE COURT SYSTEM.â€” Knowing the func- 
tion of a court, the student should then have an outline 



22 COMMERCIAL LAW 

of the court system of his own jurisdiction. We can 
only sketch, in a book to be used generally throughout 
the United States, the court systems. Each State has 
two sets of courts: the Federal and the State courts. 
We have a Federal and a State Government ; it follows 
that there should be courts to interpret the laws of 
each of these two Governments. Matters pertaining 
to the United States Constitution, or matters affecting 
citizens of different States, are tried in the Federal 
courts. The same is true of admiralty and bankruptcy. 
There is at least one United States District Court in 
each State in the country, and Federal cases are begun 
in these courts. If either party is dissatisfied with the 
decision, he may appeal to the next higher court. The 
entire country is divided into nine Circuit Courts of 
Appeal, to which appeals from United States District 
Courts are taken. In case either party is dissatisfied 
with the decision in that court, he may, in certain 
cases, appeal to the court of last resort, the United 
States Supreme Court, presided over by a Chief Jus- 
tice and eight Associate Justices at Washington. Each 
State has its own system of courts. Usually that sys- 
tem is more elaborate than that in the Federal Govern- 
ment. There is in each State a court of last resort, 
which we would expect to find designated the Supreme 
Court of New York, or whatever State it might be. 
Frequently there is a misuse of terms, as, for example, 
the court of last resort in New York is the Court of 
Appeals, and the Supreme Court is a lower court. 
This is true in a number of States. In addition to the 
court of last resort, there will be a court of general 



COMMERCIAL LAW 23 

jurisdiction, frequently one of these courts for each 
county of the State, and then courts for the trial of 
smaller cases in the various cities and towns. The 
system of appeals is the same as in the Federal courts, 
either party who is dissatisfied having a right to appeal 
his case to the higher court. The question as to 
whether a particular case must be brought in a Fed- 
eral court or a State court is too complicated to be 
taken up in detail. Sometimes the suit must be brought 
in the Federal court, as, for example, a bankruptcy 
matter, or a matter involving the United States Con- 
stitution, while in other cases, perhaps the majority, 
the suit must be brought in a State court. In other 
cases a person may have his option of either jurisdic- 
tion, as where a citizen of Texas wishes to sue a citizen 
of Rhode Island, and the amount involved is over 
$3000, then either the Federal or State courts of either 
State are open to the parties. 



CHAPTER I 



Contracts-Mutual Assent 

COMMERCIAL LAW is a general term used to 
cover the legal rules which relate most directly 
to everyday commercial transactions. It is a 
term of no exact boundary, but most commercial law 
is based in one way or another on the law of contracts, 
which is one of the largest subjects in the law. Bills 
and notes, for instance, are special forms of contracts. 
In order to understand business law at all, therefore, 
it is necessary at the outset to have some knowledge 
of the fundamental principles of the law of contracts. 
DEFINITION OF CONTRACTS.â€” What is a 
contract? Simply a promise or set of promises which 
the law enforces as binding. Any promise, if it is 
binding, is a contract or part of a contract. So the 
law of contracts in their formation resolves itself into 
this: What promises are binding? A man may make 
all sorts of promises, but when has he a right legally 
to say "I have changed my mind, I am not going to 
do what I said I would," and when will he be liable 
in damages if he fails to do as he agreed? 

CONTRACT TERMS EXPLAINED.â€” There 
are certain terms in contracts which the student will 
find repeatedly mentioned and with which he should 
be familiar at the outset. For example, contracts are 
spoken of as express contracts, and implied contracts. 
By an express contract we mean a contract the terms 
of which are fully set forth. Implied contracts are 

24 



COMMERCIAL LAW 25 

contracts the terms of which are not fully stated by 
the parties. There is a mutual agreement and prom- 
ise, but the agreement and promise have not been 
expressly put in words. If I say to a man, "I will 
buy your horse, Dobbin, for $100" and he replies, "I 
will sell you the horse at that price," there is an ex- 
press contract. I step into a taxi and simply say to 
the driver, "Take me to the Union Station." The 
driver says nothing, but takes me there. Here is an 
implied contract. By my conduct I impliedly agree 
to pay him the legal rate for the distance carried. 

FORMAL AND INFORMAL CONTRACTS. 
â€” Contracts are sometimes also divided into formal 
contracts, and simple or parol contracts. There are 
three kinds of formal contracts recognized in our sys- 
tem of law: (1) Promises under seal. (2) Contracts 
of record, such as judgments and recognizances. (3) 
Negotiable instruments. Of the three, it may be most 
difficult to understand why a judgment is included as 
a form of contract, because a judgment is simply a 
judicial termination of a fact entered in the office of 
the county clerk, and generally a lien on the real prop- 
erty owned by the judgment debtor. The sole reason, 
apparently, for calling a judgment a contract, is that 
an action of debt may be brought in a court of law 
upon such a judgment. Sealed contracts and nego- 
tiable paper will be taken up in a later chapter. 
Simple, or parol contracts, are those not embraced 
in the three previous classifications which constitute 
the formal contracts. The term parol is a little ambig- 
uous, as it is sometimes used as opposed to a written 



26 COMMERCIAL LAW 

contract, meaning simply an oral one, and at other 
times it is used as opposed to the three previous formal 
contracts. 

UNILATERAL AND BILATERAL CON- 
TRACTS. â€” Contracts are also divided into unilateral 
and bilateral contracts. In a unilateral contract, the 
contract imposes obligations on one party only. A 
promissory note is an example of a unilateral con- 
tract. In a bilateral contract, obligation is imposed 
on both parties. John and Mary become engaged to 
each other. This is a bilateral contract, and either 
may sue the other for a breach. Most important re- 
sults flow from the distinction between unilateral and 
bilateral contracts. This vje shall consider later. 

VOID, VOIDABLE AND UNENFORCE- 
ABLE CONTRACTS.â€” Contracts are also divided in- 
to void, voidable and unenforceable contracts. Strictly 
speaking, a void contract is no contract at all. Some 
statutes provide that no action shall be brought on cer- 
tain contracts, and declare them absolutely void. A 
voidable contract is one which is good until the option 
of avoiding it is availed of by the party who has the 
option. For example, an infant with an income of 
$2000 a year contracts for the delivery of a Packard 
automobile on June 1. The car, being a luxury, makes 
the contract with the infant voidable on his part, and 
he may, before June 1, repudiate the contract and 
not be liable in a suit for breach of contract, or he 
may, if he choses, abide by the contract, take the car, 
and pay the purchase price when it is delivered. An 
unenforceable contract is one which in itself is per- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 27 

fectly good as a contract, but because of some rule 
of law cannot be enforced. For example, A agrees, 
orally, with the owner of 1 Broadway, to buy that 
property for $1,000,000. The terms of the contract 
are understood by both parties. This contract is not 
enforceable, because, as we shall see later, the Statute 
of Frauds requires every contract for the sale of real 
property to be in writing. 

CONTRACTS UNDER SEAL.â€” There are two 
ways of making promises binding, and unless the 
promisor fulfils the requisites of one or the other of 
these two ways his promise will not be binding. The 
first of these ways relates to the form in which the 
promise is made; the second relates to the substance 
of the transaction, irrespective of the form. The way 
to make a promise binding by virtue of its form is to 
put it in writing and attach a seal to the writing. It 
is often thought that written promises are binding 
in any event, or that a promise that is not written 
is not binding in any event. Neither of these propo- 
sitions, however, is true. A promise is not binding 
merely because it is in writing; it is necessary that 
something more shall be done. Not only must it be 
written, but a seal must be attached in order to make 
the promise binding by virtue of its form. Everyone is 
familiar with the common ending in written con- 
tracts â€” "witness my hand and seal," that is, my signa- 
ture and seal. 

WHAT IS A SEAL?â€” A seal may beâ€” and was 
originally â€” made with sealing wax stamped with a 
crest, initial or what not. This is still a sufficient seal, 



28 COMMERCIAL LAW 

but the common kind of seal is simply a wafer attached 
by mucilage to the writing. Another kind of seal, in 
use by corporations and notaries especially, consists 
simply of an impression made on paper without at- 
taching any foreign substance whatever. Any of these 
methods of sealing a promise is good. In most States 
a written or printed scroll with the letters "L. S." 
written or printed within, or the word "Seal" written 
or printed may also be a seal if so intended. It may 
seem a ridiculous formality for the law to attach im- 
portance to this lapping a wafer and attaching it to 
the end of a writing. In a way it is ridiculous, but it 
is desirable to have some method by which a promise 
may be made binding. One method, as an original 
question, may be as good as another so long as it is 
an easy method, and attaching a seal is an easy 
method, and one which makes it possible to make a 
promise binding whenever you wish. 

CHANGE BY STATUTE OF THE LAW AS 
TO SEALED CONTRACTS,â€” There has been in 
this country a certain hostility to the law of sealed 
instruments. It has been thought, with reason, that 
some of the rules governing contracts under seal have 
by their technicality promoted injustice. This has 
certainly been true of an old rule that contracts under 
seal could not be altered or discharged by any agree- 
ment not itself under seal. The rule, however, that a 
seal avoids the necessity of consideration is a desirable 
rule, since it is important to have some means by which 
those who so intend may make gratuitous promises 
binding. It would be better then to abolish undesirable 



COMMERCIAL LAW 29 

incidents of sealed contracts by statute rather than 
to destroy totally the legal effect of a seal. However, 
in many States the distinction between sealed and 
unsealed contracts is totally abolished. In a number 
of other States the common-law rule has been changed 
by the enactment of statutory provisions to the effect^ 
that sealed contracts shall be presumed to have been 
made for a sufficient consideration, but this presump- 
tion is only prima facie, and lack of consideration may 
be affirmatively proved, even in the case of a sealed 
instrument. And under such statutes unsealed con- 
tracts remain as at common law, i. e., the burden of 
proving consideration rests upon the plaintiff who 
seeks to enforce such a contract. 

REQUISITES OF SIMPLE CONTRACTS.â€” 
Sealed contracts are comparatively easy to under- 
stand. Simple contracts, which are promises made 
binding by virtue of their substance rather than their 
form, though called simple, are more difficult to under- 
stand, and more complex. They are also much more 
common than sealed contracts. A simple contract is 
a promise, or promises, to which the parties have 
assented, and for which a price called consideration 
has been paid. One may promise as much as he wishes, 
orally or in writing so long as he does not attach a 
seal to his signature, and then say he does not care to 
keep his promise, unless he has both been paid for the 
promise and there has been an assent by the promisor 
and promisee to the terms of the transaction. Mutual 
assent and consideration are, then, the requisites of 
simple contracts. 



30 COMMERCIAL LAW 

INTENT TO CONTRACT.â€” In the law of con- 
tracts, intention, as we ordinarily understand that 
term, plays little part. In fact, the Supreme Court 
of Connecticut, in the case of Davidson vs. Holden, 55 
Conn. 103, said: "It is of no legal significance that the 
defendants did not intend to be individually liable, or 
that they did not know or believe that as a matter of 
law they would be." 

It is our overt acts that count in contracts. Or 
shall we put it this way : In the eyes of the law overt 
acts manifest legal intention. A says to B : "I will sell 
you my watch for $25, and you may have until 
9 o'clock tomorrow morning to decide." A meets B 
the next noon and says to him: "I am sorry you did 
not take the watch. It was a bargain." B replies: 
"Here is the price, I will take it. I intended to call 
you this morning but have been so busy I did not have 
an opportunity to do so. I told my wife last night I 
was going to accept your offer and I can produce five 
witnesses who were in the room and heard me say 
so." It is, nevertheless, no contract, for, as has been 
said, quoting from an old English case, "It is trite 
learning, that the thought of man is not tryable, for 
the devil himself knows not the thought of man." 
Occasionally there may be the overt act and still no 
contract, although the mere formalities of contract 
may have taken place. The facts in the case of McClurg 
v. Terry, 21 New Jersey Equity 225, were as follows: 
The plaintiff was an infant nineteen years of age, and 
hrd returned late in the evening to Jersey City, from 
an excursion, with the defendant and a number of 



COMMERCIAL LAW 31 

young friends, among whom was a justice of the 
peace, and all being in good spirits, excited by the 
excursion, the plaintiff in jest challenged the defen- 
dant to be married to her on the spot ; he in the same 
spirit accepted the challenge, and the justice, at their 
request, performed the ceremony, they making the 
proper responses. The ceremony was in the usual 
and proper form, the justice doubting whether it was 
in earnest or not. The defendant escorted the plaintiff 
to her home, and left her there as usual on occasions 
of such excursions ; both acted and treated the matter 
as if no ceremony had taken place. In deciding the 
case, the court said : "In this case the evidence is clear 
that no marriage was intended by either party; that 
it was a mere jest got up in the exuberance of spirits 
to amuse the company and themselves. If this is so, 
there was no marriage." The overt act of the parties 
manifested no legal intention to be married. Should 
we change the facts in the following way, the court 
undoubtedly would have held a valid marriage: If, 
after the parties had gone through the marriage cere- 
mony, as recited, they went on a two weeks' honey- 
moon, and on their return lived together as man and 
wife for a month and then suddenly decided to call 
the marriage off, on the ground that it was a joke and 
they did not intend the ceremony to be binding, re- 
gardless of what they said as to the transaction, their 
overt acts would be taken by the court as showing 
their real legal intention at the time the ceremony 
was entered into. One more illustration : When leav- 
ing the class tonight, there is a sudden downpour of 



32 COMMERCIAL LAW 

rain, and the instructor remarks: "I will give ten 
dollars for an umbrella.'* A student offers an um- 
brella and claims the money. Here is an overt act, but 
a reasonable person would not take the words used 
literally. Generally speaking, agreements made jok- 
ingly and social agreements confer no contractual 
rights. 

OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE.â€” The usual way 
that mutual assent is manifested is by an offer and 
an acceptance of the offer. Two persons are not likely 
to express at the identical minute the same proposi- 
tion. It is as a practical matter, then, essential that 
one should make a proposition, and if a contract is to 
be made, that the other should assent to it. An offer 
may be made to one or more specified persons, or to 
anyone v/homsoever who will do what the offer re- 
quests, as in case of an offer of a reward. An offer is 
itself a promise, but is a promise conditional on the 
payment of a consideration or return for it either by 
some act or some promise from the other party. 
According as the offer asks for an act or a promise it 
will fall into one or the other of the two great divi- 
sions of simple contracts ; one kind is called unilateral 
(meaning one-sided), that is, a promise only on one 
side ; the other is bilateral, a promise on each side. 

ILLUSTRATIONS.â€” Let us give illustrations 
of these contracts. We say to John : "We will promise 
to give you, John, $100 if you will do a specified piece 
of work." That is a proposal to make an exchange 
of the work for the money in a sense, but more exactly 
it is an offer to exchange an agreement to give the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 33 

money in return for the v/ork. We are not saying to 
John: "If you will agree or promise to do that work 
we will promise to give you the money." We are 
saying that we will give him the money if he actually 
does the work. That offer requires the actual doing of 
the work before it is binding. Until then the price 
requested for the promise has not been paid. It is an 
offer of a unilateral contract. Again, when we say to 
a man : "If you will spade up our garden we will pay 
you $2 a day," we are making an offer for a unilateral 
contract. We are asking him to spade up the garden ; 
not to promise to spade it up, but to do it, and when 
he does it he can hold us liable on our promise to pay 
him $2 a day. The promise will have become binding 
because we have been given the payment that we 
asked for in our promise. But if we say to a man : "If 
you will agree to work for us the next month we will 
pay you $100," and the man says, "All right," then we 
have a bilateral contract. We are asking him, as the 
price of our promise, not to work but to agree to 
work, and he has promised to do so. To say "I accept" 
is always sufficient acceptance in the case of a bilat- 
eral contract where a promise is requested, but if I 
said to you, "I will give you $5 if you will bring me 
a book here," it would not make a contract to say "I 
accept." I said I would give you $5 if you brought 
the book here, and nothing but bringing it here will 
form a contract. The offeree must always do what 
the offerer asks him. If an offerer asks for a promise, 
any form of words indicating assent would be suffi- 
cient, because they would mean, in effect: "I consent 



34 COMMERCIAL LAW 

to make the promise you specify in your offer." The 
form of wording in simple contracts is immaterial. 
Any plain language is sufficient for an offer, and as 
for acceptance, it does not matter whether the 
acceptor says "all right," or "I accept your offer," or 
in what form he expresses his assent. The question 
is, does he express assent? Now, the offerer is at lib- 
erty to name any consideration in his offer that he 
sees fit. He can name, in other words, whatever price 
for his promise he chooses to ask. If the person 
addressed does not choose to pay that price, all he 
has to do is to reject the offer, but he can bind the 
offerer only on the terms proposed. Therefore, if the 
offerer asks for an act in return for his promise, that 
is, asks for an immediate payment, or work, or the 
giving of property for his promise, no contract can be 
made by the person addressed saying, "All right, I 
will do it;" that is not giving the price the offerer 
asked. On the other hand, should the offerer ask 
for a promise and not for an act, the acceptor must 
give the promise asked for. 

OPTION WITHOUT CONSIDERATION.â€” 
A common business transaction that presents very 
well the principles governing the formation of simple 
contracts is what is called an option. Suppose the 
owner of a mine says: "I will sell you this mine for 
$50,000, and you may have thirty days to decide 
whether you choose to accept the offer or not." Now, 
it does not matter whether that statement is oral or 
in writing; it is merely an offer, and not binding as 
the matter stands as far as we have stated. However, 



COMMERCIAL LAW 35 

if it were in writing and a seal attached (in a State 
where seals still have the force which the common 
law gave them) it would be a binding promise to sell 
the mine at that price at any time within thirty days. 
If there is no seal attached, as long as the offer is 
unaccepted and unpaid for, it is not binding. The man 
who makes it may say: "I withdraw my offer. It is 
true that I promised to keep the offer open thirty days, 
but you did not pay me for that promise and I am 
going to break the promise. I withdraw my offer." 
Any offer for the formation of a simple contract, while 
unaccepted, may be withdrawn. But, if before it was 
withdrawn and within the thirty days' limit, the per- 
son to whom the option was given says, "Here is the 
$50,000 which you said you would take for your 
mine," the offerer would then be bound, and would 
have to perform his part of the contract. 

OPTION WITH CONSIDERATION.â€” Let us 
change the character of the option a little. Suppose 
in consideration of $1000 paid down the owner of a 
mine promises to sell the mine for $50,000 at any time 
within thirty days. Here the offer, or the contract â€” 
for it is now more than an offer â€” has been paid for, 
and it is therefore binding. The person to whom the 
offer was made paid $1000 for the promise, therefore 
the promisor is bound to keep it. It was not an abso- 
lute promise to give the mine to the buyer, but it was 
a promise to sell it to him for $50,000 if he chose to 
take it within thirty days ; that is a conditional prom- 
ise. A conditional promise may be binding and paid 
for just as well as an absolute promise. 



36 COMMERCIAL LAW 

INSURANCE POLICY.â€” Take the case of a 
fire insurance policy. That is a conditional promise, 
a promise to pay indemnity for the destruction of a 
house by fire. Therefore, the performance of the 
insurance company's promise is conditional on the 
suffering by the insured of loss by fire. An insurance 
policy is ordinarily a unilateral contract; the premium 
is the consideration or price paid for the promise, and 
the promise is binding on the insurance company 
from the time when the premium is thus paid. Of 
course, the promise is only binding according to its 
terms. The insured has bought a conditional promise, 
a promise to pay if the house burns down. He gets 
that promise, but he will not become entitled to any 
money or any damages unless the house burns dov/n 
nor unless he complies with the other conditions of 
his policy. 

GUARANTEE.â€” Another kind of a promise 
worth referring to is a guarantee. A question arises 
whether a business house will sell something to a 
buyer on credit, and it decides it will not without a 
guarantee. Accordingly, John agrees, in writing, that 
if the business house in question will sell James a bill 
of goods, John will guarantee the payment of the 
price. That means, if James does not pay for the 
goods, John will. That is a unilateral contract in 
which the promise is conditional, and the considera- 
tion for that promise is the selling of goods to James. 
PRELIMINARY NEGOTIATIONSâ€” ADVER- 
TISEMENTS.â€” An offer is sometimes difficult 
to distinguish from other things. Suppose the case of 



COMMERCIAL LAW 37 

an advertisement. A business house advertises that 
it vi^ill sell goods for a certain price. Take the case of 
a bond list issued by a banking house. The list states 
that the banking house vi^ill sell specified kinds of 
bonds at quoted prices. John receives one of those 
lists, looks it over, sees something that looks good to 
him, and goes into the banking house and says: "I 
will take five of those bonds at the price named here." 
The banking house says : "We have sold all the bonds 
of that kind that we had ;" or it says, "The market has 
changed on those bonds and there has been some 
advance in the price." Has John a cause of action 
against the banking house? He has if that bond list 
amounts to an offer â€” that is, if the list means that 
the banking house offers to enter into a contract with 
anyone receiving the list. But it has been held that 
that sort of advertisement does not prima facie 
amount to an offer, although it might be put in such 
clear words of agreement to sell on the part of the 
banking house that it would amount to an offer. Gen- 
erally an advertisement of this sort, or anything that 
can fairly be called an advertisement of goods for 
sale, is held to mean simply that the advertiser has 
these goods for sale and names a price he is putting 
upon them; he invites customers to come in and deal 
with him in regard to them. It is an invitation to 
come and make a trade rather than a direct offer of 
a trade. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” Again to illustrate: You 
are looking at a new model of an automobile in a 
show-room window. You like it, enter the sales- 



no^ana^ 



38 COMMERCIAL LAW 

room, and say you will take the car, tendering the 
price. The manager tells you that it is simply their 
demonstration car, that he will be glad to book your 
order for a car of the same model, and can- make deliv- 
ery in a month. You are not satisfied, and wish to 
sue, claiming that your tender of the price constituted 
an acceptance of the dealer's offer. Your position 
would be unsound and there would be no recovery 
in such a case The placing of the demonstration car 
in the window is simply an invitation to the public to 
come in and deal with the seller. On the other hand, 
suppose you go into a second-hand automobile sales- 
room. There are fifty cars of various makes and 
models on the floor and each one is labeled with a 
different price. You pick out a 1918 Packard which is 
marked $1500. You tender the price to the salesman 
and say you will take the car. He refuses to sell. In 
this case your tender is an acceptance of his offer to 
sell. In the former instance, placing a price on the 
demonstration car was not a statement to the public 
generally that that particular car was for sale at that 
price, but in this case, where the cars are all second- 
hand cars, the reasonable interpretation of placing 
the price on the 1918 Packard is that that particular 
car is for sale. Quite likely, the dealer did not have 
any other Packard car in stock and would have no 
way of securing any of that model at that price. 

ORAL AGREEMENT PRELIMINARY TO 
WRITTEN CONTRACT.â€” Another case of the 
same nature that comes up not infrequently is this. 
Parties talk over a business arrangement and then 



COMMERCIAL LAW 39 

they say, "As this is an important matter let us put 
it down in writing; let us have a written contract 
containing what has been agreed upon." When it 
comes to drawing up the contract, however, they 
cannot agree. One party then says, "Well, we made 
a definite oral agreement any way; let us carry that 
out." The other replies, "Why, no, all that was de- 
pendent on our making a written agreement." The 
settlement of their dispute depends on how definite 
and absolute the oral agreement was. It is possible 
to make an oral agreement binding, although the 
parties do agree and do contemplate that it shall sub- 
sequently be reduced to writing, but generally the 
inference is that the oral agreement was merely a 
preliminary chaffering to fix the terms of the writing, 
and that everything is tentative until the writing is 
made and signed 

AUCTION SALES.â€” Another state of affairs 
involving preliminary invitations is presented by 
auction sales. The auctioneer puts goods up for sale, 
a bid is made, the auctioneer gets no other bid, and 
then says, "I will withdraw this from sale." Is the 
auctioneer liable? Has he made a contract to sell 
that article to the highest bidder? When the trans- 
action is analyzed, is this what the auctioneer says in 
effect : "I offer to sell these goods to the highest bid- 
der?" If this is the correct interpretation, then when 
the highest bidder says, in effect, "I agree to buy 
them," there would be a contract. On the other hand, 
if what the auctioneer says is in effect like what the 
advertiser says: "Here are some goods for sale, what 



40 COMMERCIAL LAW 

do you bid, gentlemen," then the auctioneer is not 
making an offer himself. He is inviting offers from 
the people before him, and until he accepts one of 
those offers from the bidders before him there would 
be no contract; and until then the auctioneer could 
vv^ithdraw the goods. And that is the construction put 
upon the auction sale â€” that the auctioneer is not 
making an offer, but is simply inviting offers. Even 
if the auctioneer promises that he v^ill accept the 
highest offer, that is, that he will sell to the highest 
bidder, his promise to accept the highest bid, not 
being paid for, would not be binding upon him were 
it not for a statute in some States which, in the sale 
of goods, would make an auctioneer bound to keep a 
promise to sell without reserve, that is, to the highest 
bidder, if he made such a promise. 

BIDS OR TENDERS.â€” Somewhat similar to 
the case of the auctioneer is the case of tenders or 
bids for the construction of buildings, or for the sale 
of goods to a city or to a corporation. There, too, the 
corporation or the city is simply inviting offers. They 
do not say, "We offer to enter into a contract with 
anyone who makes the lowest bid," but rather, "We 
are thinking of entering into a contract, and we want 
to receive offers in regard to it." When the offers are 
made by the bids or tenders, any or none of them may 
be accepted, according as the receiver thinks best. It 
is sometimes required by law that public corpora- 
tions, like cities or counties, shall accept the bid of 
the lowest responsible bidder, but, aside from such 
statutes, any or none of the bids may be accepted. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 41 

IMPLIED CONTRACTS.â€” An offer and accep- 
tance are ordinarily made by words either spoken or 
written; but any method of communication which 
would convey to a reasonable man a clear meaning 
will serve as well as words. If A goes to his grocer 
and says "Send me a barrel of flour," he has in terms 
made no promise to pay for the flour, but the natural 
meaning of his v/ords is that he agrees to pay. In this 
case A used words, though not words of promise; but 
the same result might follow where no words at all 
were used. Suppose A went into a shop where he was 
known, picked up an article from the counter, held it 
up so the proprietor could see what he was taking, 
and went out ; this would be in legal effect a promise 
by A to pay for the article. A contract, where the 
promises of the parties are to be inferred not from 
express words of promise but from conduct or from 
language not in terms promissory, is called an implied 
promise or contract, as distinct from an express 
promise or contract, which is one v/here the under- 
taking is in express language. This difference between 
express and implied contracts relates merely to the 
mode of proving them. There is the same element 
of mutual assent in both cases, and the legal effect 
of the two kinds of obligations is identical. There is, 
however, another kind of obligation which is fre- 
quently called an implied contract, but sometimes 
called a quasi-contract, because it is not really a con- 
tract at all, though the obligation imposed is similar. 
If a husband fails to support his wife, for instance, 
she may bind him by purchases of goods necessary 



42 COMMERCIAL LAW 

for her support. She may do this even though he 
directly forbids the sales to her. There is obviously 
no mutual assent in this case; the husband emphat- 
ically dissents and expresses his dissent, but he is 
bound just as if he had contracted. 

TERMINATION OF OFFER BY REVOCA- 
TION OR REJECTION.â€” Since offers do not be- 
come binding until accepted according to their terms, 
up to that time they may be terminated v^ithout lia- 
bility. This may happen in several ways. In the first 
place an offer may be revoked by the offerer. To 
effect a revocation he must actually notify the other 
party of his change of mind, before the latter has 
accepted. We have already stated that offers may be 
rejected by the person to whom they are made. For 
instance, we say, "We offer you one hundred shares 
of stock at a certain price, and you may have a week 
to think it over." You say, *T do not care for that 
offer, I reject it." You come around the next day and 
say, "On reflection I have concluded to accept that 
offer." The acceptance is within the seven days which 
we originally said might be used for reflection, but 
the offer has been terminated by the rejection. There 
is no longer any offer open, and consequently the 
acceptance amounts to nothing. A troublesome ques- 
tion in regard to the revocation of an offer for a uni- 
lateral contract is this: Suppose A offers B $5 for a 
book and B starts to get it but when he reaches the 
door, then A refuses to take the book. The general 
disposition is to try to hold that promise binding, and 
yet the difficulty is that the offeree has not fully done 



COMMERCIAL LAW 43 

what he was asked to do, and if he chose to turn back 
and take the book away he could do so without lia- 
bility. He could say, "I did not promise to bring the 
book. I brought it part way, the walk was long and 
I am going to take it back." If he is thus free to with- 
draw it seems impossible to deny that the other party 
is equally free. Bilateral contracts are more desirable 
than unilateral because in bilateral contracts the 
mutual promises bind the parties before they begin 
to perform and both parties are therefore protected 
while they are performing. In unilateral contracts, 
the contract is not completed until the act requested 
is fully done. Until then, therefore, either party may 
withdraw. 

A COUNTER OFFER IS A REJECTION.â€” 
Another way in which offers may be terminated is 
by a counter offer on the part of the person to whom 
the offer was made. We say, "We will sell you stock 
for $100 a share, and you may have a week to think it 
over." You say, "I will give you $99 a share." We 
say, "No, we will not take it." You say, "Well, I will 
give you $100." You are too late; you rejected our 
offer of sale at $100 by saying you would give us $99. 
The minute you say you will give us $99, our offer is 
rejected. Of course, when you make the counter offer 
of $99, if we say we will accept your offer to buy, that 
would make a contract. Offers are constantly rejected 
by counter offers by people who really intend to enter 
into a contract. Suppose A says, "I will lease you my 
house a year for $800." You say, "All right, I will 
take it if you paper the dining-room." That rejects 



44 COMMERCIAL LAW 

the offer. A new offer has been made by the person 
addressed, who offers, if the dining-room is papered, 
to take the house at $800. 

TERMINATION OF OFFER BY DEATH 
OR INSANITY. â€” An offer is also terminated by the 
death or insanity of either party before acceptance. 
After a contract has once been formed neither subse- 
quent death nor insanity terminates liability upon it 
unless the contract is of such a personal character 
that only performance by the contractor in person 
will fulfil it. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” In Beach v. First Metho- 
dist Episcopal Church, 96 111. 177, a fund was being 
raised to build a new church, and a subscription paper, 
as follows, was signed by Lorenzo Beach : 

"Fairbury, Feb. 14, 1874. 

"We, the undersigned, agree to pay the sum set 
opposite our respective names, for the purpose of 
erecting a new M. E. church in this place, said sums 
to be paid as follows : One-third to be paid when con- 
tract is let, one-third when building is enclosed, one- 
third when building is completed. Probable cost of 
said church from ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to 
twelve thousand dollars ($12,000)." 

Mr. Beach attached and subscribed to that paper 
the following: 

"Fairbury, 1874. 

"Dr. Beach gives this subscription on the condi- 
tion that the remainder of eight thousand dollars is 
subscribed. 

"Lorenzo Beach, $2000." 



COMMERCIAL LAW 45 

In April, 1875, Dr. Beach v/as adjudged insane 
by the county court. The court held that the "sub- 
scription made by Dr. Beach was, in its nature, a mere 
offer to pay that amount of money to the church upon 
the condition therein expressed. There is nothing in 
the record tending to show that the church, in this 
case, took any action upon the faith of this subscrip- 
tion, until after Dr. Beach was adjudged insane, or 
that the church paid money or incurred any liability. 
His insanity, by operation of law, was a revocation 
of the offer." Suppose a letter for a v/inter's supply 
of coal is sent to your coal dealer and is acknowledged 
by him, delivery to be made before October 1. On 
September 15, the coal dealer dies, and his estate 
refuses to fulfill the contract. In such a case, if you 
were compelled to buy coal at a higher price from 
another dealer, you would have a cause of action 
against the estate for the damage you suffer. The 
coal dealer's executor or administrator could very 
easily carry out a contract of this character. On the 
other hand, suppose you are running a series of lec- 
tures during the winter, and you have engaged a 
noted lecturer to deliver six lectures. After he has 
delivered three, he dies. In this case, death would ter- 
minate the contract, as this is clearly a contract for 
personal services and the executor or administrator 
of the deceased lecturer could not perform the con- 
tract for him, as could be done in the case of the coal 
dealer. 

TERMINATION OF OFFER BY LAPSE OF 
TIME. â€” An offer may be terminated by delay on the 



46 COMMERCIAL LAW 

part of the person addressed. An answer to an offer 
must be sent in time, whether mail or telegraph is 
used, or whether the parties are dealing face to face. 
An offer lapses if it is not accepted within the time 
the offer specifies if any time is specified. If no time 
is specified, then within a reasonable time. One may 
specify any length of time in his offer, and it will 
remain open for that time provided it is not rejected 
or revoked, and neither party dies or becomes insane, 
in the meantime. But frequently offers contain no 
express limit of time; then it is a question of what is 
a reasonable time, and reasonableness depends upon 
business customs, the character of the transaction, 
the way the offer is communicated, and similar cir- 
cumstances. An offer on the floor of a stock exchange 
will not last very long. A reasonable time for accep- 
tance of such an offer is immediately, and an offer 
sent by telegraph will not remain in force long. The 
use of the telegraph indicates that the offerer deems 
haste of importance. An offer sent by mail will last 
longer. An offer relating to things which change in 
value rapidly will not remain open for so long a time 
as an offer which relates to land, or something that 
does not change in value rapidly. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” In the case of Loring v. 
the City of Boston, 7 Met. (Mass.) 409, the facts were 
that on May 26, 1837, this advertisement was pub- 
lished in the daily papers of Boston: "$500 reward. 
The above reward is offered for the apprehension and 
conviction of any person who shall set fire to any 
building within the limits of the city. May 26th, 1837. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 47 

Samuel A. Eliot, Mayor." In January, 1841, there 
was an extensive fire on Washington Street, and Lor- 
ing, after considerable effort, was able to secure the 
apprehension and conviction of the criminal. He 
then sued to recover the reward, which the city of 
Boston refused to pay. The ground of defense was 
that the advertisement "offering the reward of $500 
for the apprehension and conviction of persons set- 
ting fire to buildings in the city, was issued almost 
four years before the time at which the plaintiff ar- 
rested Marriott and prosecuted him to conviction." 
The opinion of the court reads : "three years and eight 
months is not a reasonable time within which, or 
rather to the extent of which, the offer in question 
can be considered as a continuing offer on the part of 
the city. In that length of time, the exigency under 
which it was made having passed, it must be pre- 
sumed to have been forgotten by most of the officers 
and citizens of the community, and cannot be pre- 
sumed to have been before the public as an actuating 
motive to vigilance and exertion on this subject ; nor 
could it justly and reasonably have been so under- 
stood by the plaintiff. We are, therefore, of the 
opinion that the offer of the city had ceased before 
the plaintiff accepted and acted upon it as such, and 
that consequently no contract existed upon which 
this action, founded on an alleged express promise, 
can be maintained." 

BOTH PARTIES MUST BE BOUND OR 
NEITHER. â€” Both parties to a simple contract must 
in effect be bound, and until they are, there is no 



48 COMMERCIAL LAW 

contract. In a unilateral contract, before the prom- 
ise becomes binding, the promisee must have actually 
performed what he was requested to do, that is, he 
must bind himself by actual performance before the 
offerer's promise is binding on him. In a bilateral con- 
tract, where each party makes a promise, neither 
promise can be binding unless and until the other one 
is. So that in the case of the proposed agreement to 
lease, as the proposed tenant might refuse to take the 
house if the dining-room was not papered, the pro- 
posed landlord has a similar right; that is, since one 
is not bound, the other is not. 

CONTRACTS BY CORRESPONDENCE.â€” 
Contracts are often made by correspondence, simple 
contracts especially. That raises rather an impor- 
tant question as to how and when the contract is 
formed. Suppose a letter containing an offer is ad- 
dressed from Boston to a man in New York. A reply 
is sent by him from New York accepting the offer. 
That reply goes astray. Is there a contract? Yes. 
It creates a contract by correspondence for a letter 
to be mailed by the acceptor provided the offerer im- 
poses no conditions to the contrary, and impliedly 
authorizes the use of the mails, as he does by him- 
self making an offer by mail. But suppose the offerer 
in his letter says, "If I hear from you by next Wed- 
nesday I shall consider this a contract." Then, unless 
the offerer receives an ansvv^er by the next Wednes- 
day, there will be no contract. It will make no differ- 
ence that an answer has been mailed, it must have 
been received; that is a condition of the offer. Sup- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 49 

pose an offer is made by word of mouth, and it is 
accepted by sending a letter. Does the contract then 
become binding, irrespective of receipt of the letter? 
No, unless in some way the offerer has authorized the 
use of the mails in sending such an answer, and if the 
circumstances were such that the use of the mails 
would be customary, that would amount to an im- 
plied authorization. The use of the telegraph de- 
pends upon similar principles. If an offer is sent by 
telegraph, an answer may be sent by telegraph, and 
an acceptance started on its way will become binding 
although it is never received. Similarly, one may 
authorize a telegraphic answer to a letter containing 
an offer sent by mail, and if the use of the telegraph is 
authorized, a contract will arise at the moment that 
the telegram is sent. 

ILLUSTRATIONS.â€” In the case of an option, 
if the acceptance was made by mail and lost in the 
mails, a binding contract would be formed if the use 
of the mail was expressly or impliedly authorized, 
and similarly if the option called for payment and a 
letter was mailed containing a draft or cash. There 
is a right to send a check or draft by mail if the par- 
ties had been dealing by mail. That authority would 
be implied. When parties are dealing by mail and 
there is a bargain that a check shall be sent, the check 
becomes the property of the person to whom it is 
sent as soon as it is mailed, and, therefore, when the 
letter with the check is put in the mail it operates 
as a payment on the option, and the loss of the draft 
is not the sender's loss, but the other man's. A lost 



50 COMMERCIAL LAW 

draft, however, can be replaced and must be replaced. 
Authority to send actual cash by mail would not be 
so easily implied, especially if the amount were large, 
because it is contrary to good business custom; but if 
authority were given, the result would be the same 
as in the case of a check. It would, however, be a prop- 
er business precaution to register the letter if it con- 
tained cash. If the offerer, not having received the 
letter of acceptance and thinking none had been sent, 
sells the property to another person, though not mor- 
ally blamable, he would get into trouble. The second 
purchaser v/ould get title to the property, supposing 
that the property was actually transferred to him. 
The lost letter created a contract, but it did not ac- 
tually transfer title to the property, and, therefore, 
when the purchaser actually got possession of the 
property he would become the owner of it and could 
not be deprived of his title if he took it innocently. 
If, however, the person to whom the property was 
transferred had notice of the prior completion of a 
contract, he could not keep the property. In any 
event the seller would be liable in damages for breach 
of the contract completed by mailing the lost letter. 
Suppose an option is given by telephone to one who, 
just before the option expires, tries to get a connection 
by phone to accept and is unable to do so, and ten 
minutes after the time has expired a connection is 
secured? There is no contract and he has no action. 
It is no fault of the offerer that the acceptor was 
unable to accept in time, and, generally speaking, 
one who wishes to accept an offer must at his peril 



COMMERCIAL LAV/ 51 

keep the means of acceptance open. It may be asked 
why does not the same principle apply in regard to 
mail as to the telephone ; that is, why does not start- 
ing the acceptance by telephone complete the con- 
tract? Because there is no authority to send com- 
munication by telephone to the offerer when the ac- 
ceptor has no telephone connection. When one 
sends an offer by mail the reason that he is bound by 
an acceptance sent by mail is because he, in effect, 
asks that an acceptance properly addressed to him be 
started on its course. He takes his chance as to the 
rest, but an offerer by telephone does not authorize 
a reply by talking into the telephone when there is no 
connection. 

MISTAKES IN THE USE OF LANGUAGE 
IN OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE.â€” Another ques- 
tion which has to do with the express mutual assent 
of parties relates to the meaning of language used. 
Suppose an offerer says, "I will sell you a cargo of 
goods from the ship 'Peerless,' due to arrive from 
India, at a certain price." The buyer assents. There 
are two ships named "Peerless," and the buyer thinks 
one is meant, but the seller thinks the other is meant. 
Is there a contract for the sale of the cargo of "Peer- 
less" No. 1, or a contract for the sale of the cargo of 
No. 2, or no contract at all? The answer is, that 
language bears the meaning which a reasonable per- 
son in the position of the person to whom the offer 
is made is justified in attaching to it. If a reason- 
able person in his position would think "Peerless" No. 
1 was meant, then there is a contract for the cargo of 



52 COMMERCIAL LAW 

No. 1. If he was not justified in thinking that, and 
ought to have thought No. 2 was meant, although in 
fact he did not think so, there was a contract for the 
cargo of "Peerless" No. 2. If either meaning were as 
reasonable as the other, then each party has a right 
to insist on his own meaning, and there would be no 
contract. This principle often comes up in contracts 
made by telegraph, where the words of the telegram 
are, by the mistake of the telegraph company, 
changed. For instance, a telegram purports to be an 
offer to sell a large quantity of laths at $1 a bundle. 
The terms as actually despatched by the seller in 
making his offer fixed the price at $1.20. The tele- 
graph company dropped off the words "and twenty 
cents." A telegram is sent back by the buyer, "I ac- 
cept your telegraphic offer." Then trouble arises 
when buyer and seller compare notes. Well, the of- 
ferer is bound. He selected the telegraph as the 
means of communication, and he must take the con- 
sequences of a misunderstanding, which arose from a 
mistake of the agency which the offerer himself 
selected. The question may be asked: Would there 
be any right of action against the telegraph company 
by the offerer, the sender of the telegram? The an- 
swer is yes. The company has broken the contract it 
impliedly made with the sender to use reasonable 
diligence in despatching and delivering the message. 
But the trouble with that action is that on telegraph 
blanks there is always this in substance: that on un- 
repeated telegrams this company is liable for mis- 
takes only to an amount not exceeding twice the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 53 

cost of the telegram; and it has been held in many 
States that that limit on unrepeated telegrams is not 
unreasonable. The sender of the telegram has agreed 
to the contract on the reverse side of the telegraph 
blank, and he ought to have his message repeated if he 
desires to hold the company liable in full damages if 
his message does not reach the party addressed in 
absolutely correct form. In other States, however, 
this limitation of liability is held to be against public 
policy and the company is liable for the full damage 
suffered. 

CONDITION IN OFFER REQUIRING RE- 
CEIPT OF ACCEPTANCE.â€” An offerer, as has 
been said, may insert in his offer any condition he sees 
fit. He may therefore insert a condition that an ac- 
ceptance shall reach him, not merely be despatched. 
The condition may specify the time within which the 
acceptance must arrive in order to be effectual. It is 
a wise precaution in all business offers of importance 
to insert such a condition in the offer. It will not 
be sufficient to add to the offer such words as "sub- 
ject to prompt acceptance," for prompt acceptance 
would be given, within the meaning of the law, by 
despatching the acceptance, not by the receipt of it. 
The condition should be in such words as "subject to 
prompt receipt of your acceptance," or "subject to 
receipt of your acceptance," by a stated day or hour. 

WHEN SILENCE GIVES CONSENT.â€” 
There is one way of manifesting mutual assent, 
namely, by silence, of which a word should be said. 
There is a proverb that "Silence gives consent." Is 



54 COMMERCIAL LAW 

it so in law? Suppose a man goes into an insurance 
broker's and tosses some policies down and says, 
"Renew those policies, please.'* Nobody says any- 
thing and he leaves the policies there and goes out. 
The next night his buildings burn down. Are they 
insured? They are, in effect, if the insurance broker 
has contracted to renew the policies; otherwise the 
buildings are not insured. Now on the bare facts, as 
we have stated them, they are not insured; some 
other facts must always exist to make silence amount 
to assent. If, for instance, on previous occasions, the 
broker kept silence when such statements were made 
to him, and nevertheless carried out the proposal, it 
is a fair inference that he means by his silence this 
time what he meant the preceding time. Further- 
more, silence, when the offer is unknown, can never 
amount to assent. In the case as we have put it, we 
did not say that the insurance broker even heard the 
offer; if he did, then the question would depend on 
whether he had ever done anything to justify the 
other person in believing that silence would mean as- 
sent in such a dealing, or whether business customs 
justified the assumption. The offerer cannot by his 
own act m.ake the silence of the other person amount 
to an acceptance. Suppose an offer of this sort: "We 
offer to sell you 100 shares of stock at $50 a share, 
and unless we hear from you to the contrary by next 
Wednesday we shall conclude that you have accepted 
our offer." The offerer does not get any word before 
next Wednesday. Nevertheless, there is no contract. 
The person addressed has a right to say, "Confound 



COMMERCIAL LAW 55 

his impudence, I am not going to waste a postage 
stc mp on him, but I don't accept his offer. He has no 
business to suppose that if he doesn't hear from me to 
the contrary I assent." This sort of case is not in- 
frequently referred to: A magazine is sent through 
the mails on a subscription for a year, the subscrip- 
tion runs out, the magazine is, nevertheless, still sent. 
Is the person who receives it bound to pay another 
year's subscription? Here you have a little more 
than silence; you have the receiver of the magazine 
continuing to receive it. If he refused to receive it, 
undoubtedly there would be no contract, but v/here 
a man takes property which is offered to him, he is 
bound by the proposal which was made to him in 
regard to the property. He ought to let the magazine 
alone if he doesn't want to pay for it. You may say 
that the receiver does not know that the subscription 
has run out, and if he did he would not take the 
magazine. But then he ought to know. He made the 
subscription originally. The difficulty is merely in 
his own forgetfulness, and he cannot rely on that. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” The leading case of Hobbs 
V. Massasoit Whip Co., 158 Mass. 194, is a good il- 
lustration. The plaintiff in this case had been in the 
habit of sending eel skins to the defendant and had 
received pay from him in due course. The skins in 
the shipment for payment of which suit was brought, 
were alleged by the defendant to be short of the re- 
quired length, and in a condition unfit for use. They 
were kept by the defendant some months, and were 
then destroyed, without notification to the plaintiff. 



56 COMMERCIAL LAW 

The latter sued for the price of the skins and the court 
held that the silence of the defendant and failure to 
notify the plaintiff that it did not wish to have this 
particular lot of skins, amounted to an acceptance. 
The court said: "In such a condition of things, the 
plaintiff was warranted in sending the defendant 
skins conforming to the requirements, and even if the 
offer was not such that the contract was made as soon 
as the skins corresponding to its terms were sent, 
sending them would impose on the defendant a duty 
to act at that time; and silence on its part, coupled 
with a retention of the skins for an unreasonable 
time, might be found by the jury to warrant the plain- 
tiff in assuming that they were accepted, and thus 
to amount to an acceptance." 



CHAPTER II 



Contracts-Consideration and 
Enforceability 

CONSIDERATION MAY BE ANOTHER 
PROMISE OR AN ACT.â€” The second great 
requisite in the formation of simple contracts is 
consideration. A price must be paid for a promise in 
order to make it binding. The price paid may be an- 
other promise, in which case the contract is bilateral, 
or the price paid may be some act actually done or per- 
formed, in which case the contract is unilateral. 

ADEQUACY OF CONSIDERATION IM- 
MATERIAL. â€” Not any act, or the promise of any 
act, is sufficient consideration, as will be seen. Nev- 
ertheless, in general the law does not attempt to 
gauge the adequacy of the consideration; that is, 
parties may make such bargains as they wish as far 
as the price is concerned. A may say that he will 
sell his horse, which is worth $300, for $100, or for a 
promise to pay $100. That will be a perfectly good 
contract, if accepted, in spite of the fact that the 
promised horse is worth more than the promised 
price. Such difference in the value of the promise 
and the value of the price may go to a great extreme. 
The horse may be a thousand-dollar animal, and the 
price promised only $100, but when you wish to push 
the case to an extreme you are likely to get into this 
difficulty: Did the parties really mean to make a bar- 

57 



58 COMMERCIAL LAW 

gain? If what they were doing was arranging for 
a gift of the horse and putting up some little alleged 
consideration as a blind, that will not do; but any ex- 
change the parties really in good faith bargain for, 
with certain exceptions hereafter stated, is sufficient. 
A SMALLER SUM OF MONEY IS NOT 
SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION FOR THE 
PROMISE SIMULTANEOUSLY TO PAY OR 
DISCHARGE A LARGER LIQUIDATED SUM. 
â€” This is the principal exception, that in contracts 
or promises relating to a fixed sum of money, the 
consideration cannot be the simultaneous payment 
or discharge of a smaller sum of money on the other 
side. If A promises B $100, it will not be good con- 
sideration for B to promise in exchange $50, or even 
$99.99, payable at the same time and place. In 
other words, the law does require adequacy in ex- 
changes or agreements to exchange money. A 
owes B $100 and says to him, "I can't pay it all," or 
"I don't want to pay it all. Will you let me off for 
$50?" B replies, "Yes, I will take $50." That 
agreement is not binding, and even if the $50 is ac- 
tually paid, B may afterwards come and say, "You 
paid me only part of the debt you owed me. It is 
true I said I would call the whole thing square, but 
there was no consideration sufficient in law for my 
promise, since you paid me only part of what you 
were bound to." This rule of common law, though gen- 
erally well established, does not exist or is much quali- 
fied in a few States, such as: Georgia, Maine, Mis- 
sissippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Virginia. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 59 

UNLIQUIDATED CLAIMS MAY BE DIS- 
CHARGED BY ANY AGREED SUM.â€” The case 
cited in the preceding paragraph must be distinguished 
from another. Suppose A owes B some money for 
services, the price of which was never exactly fixed, 
but which B says are of the value of $100. Then if B 
agrees to take $50 in satisfaction of his claim against 
A, B is bound ; the transaction is effectual. The dif- 
ference is between what is called a liquidated and an 
unliquidated claim. 

DEFINITION OF LIQUIDATED CLAIM. 
â€” A liquidated claim is one of an exact amount def- 
initely fixed. Such a claim, as has been said, cannot 
be satisfied by partial payment or promise of partial 
payment. But an unliquidated or a disputed claim â€” a 
claim subject to a real bona fide dispute, not merely a 
dispute trumped up for the purpose of disputing a good 
claim â€” may be discharged by any payment on which 
the parties agree. The law does not know how much 
the unliquidated claim is worth, and will allow parties 
to bargain for the sale of the unliquidated claim, just 
as it will let them bargain for the sale of a horse for 
which they may fix such a price as they choose, and 
that price will not be revised. 

EFFECT OF RELEASES AND RECEIPTS.â€” 
If, however, the original claim were liquidated and 
undisputed, is there any sort of paper the debtor could 
get from the creditor that would release him ab- 
solutely? A receipt in full would not do it; a receipt in 
full is something to which business men attach more 
virtue than it possesses. It is merely evidence of an 



60 COMMERCIAL LAW 

agreement to accept what has been received in full 
payment and proof may be given as to just what con- 
sideration passed for the receipt in full. As we have 
seen, such an agreement is not valid without con- 
sideration, and payment of part of a debt admittedly 
due is not sufficient consideration. The really effective 
instrument at common law is the release under seal. 
That will do the work whether the debtor paid part 
of the debt or not, since a sealed instrument needs no 
consideration. In jurisdictions where seals have been 
deprived of their efficacy at common law an insuper- 
able difficulty, however, exists. In a few States â€” Ala- 
bama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Michigan, Mississippi, 
New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, South 
Dakota, Tennessee â€” a receipt in full has been given 
the effect which the common law gave to a sealed 
instrument. 

OTHER ILLUSTRATIONS.â€” Suppose the 
agreem.ent to settle a liquidated claim were oral and 
suppose a witness heard the words. Such circum- 
stances would not make any difference. It is assumed 
in all that has been said that the facts are proved. 
Suppose that neither party denied the facts. Let the 
creditor admit that he did receive this $50 as a full 
payment and did give the debtor a receipt in full. 
Still, he can say, "I propose to break my agreement 
since it was not supported by sufficient consideration, 
and I shall collect the balance.'* Another question is 
this: Suppose a man had a $100 bill and he wanted 
some change very badly, and another man had $99. 
Could the former take that for the $100 bill? He could. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 61 

If a man wants a particular kind of money, as gold, 
or silver, or quarters, the principles stated do not 
apply; they apply only to dollars and cents as such. 

PAST CONSIDERATION.â€” Strictly speaking, 
the term past consideration is a misnomer ; something 
which is given before a promise is made cannot con- 
stitute a legal consideration. The courts have held 
that a warranty made after a sale has been completed 
is invalid. It has also been held that a guaranty after 
the obligation guaranteed has been entered into also 
is invalid unless there be new consideration. Al- 
though this is the general rule, there are several ex- 
ceptions where a past consideration is recognized. 
Williston gives these exceptions as follows, although 
the boundaries between the groups are sometimes in- 
definite: *'(1) Promises to pay a precedent debt; (2) 
Promises in consideration of some act previously done 
by the promisee at the request of the promisor; (3) 
Promises where past circumstances create a moral 
obligation on the part of the promisor to perform his 
promise. Under this head may be included cases of 
ratification and ?doption of promises previously made 
for sufficient consideration but invalid when made for 
lack of authority or capacity." 

PAYMENT OF PART OF A DEBT BY ONE 
WHO IS NOT THE DEBTOR.â€” Suppose a little 
different case: A owes B $100 for a liquidated claim. 
A's father says to B, "If you will let my son off, dis- 
charge him from this claim, I will pay $60, not a cent 
more." B agrees, and the $60 is paid. Now B never 
can get any more; the bargain is binding, and the 



62 COMMERCIAL LAW 

reason is, that although A was bound to pay the whole 
$100, and could not, by paying B a part of the claim, 
give good consideration to B for his promise to cancel 
the balance. A's father was not bound to pay a cent 
and he may bargain for any exchange in return for a 
payment which he was not bound to make at all. 
Therefore, he may bargain that the debt shall be dis- 
charged. 

PERFORMANCE OR PROMISE OF PER- 
FORMANCE OF A LEGAL DUTY IS NOT SUF- 
FICIENT CONSIDERATION.â€” In other words, 
the thing which will not be good consideration, 
whether done or promised, is the performance or par- 
tial performance of something which the man who 
performs or promises is under a legal duty to do 
anyv/ay. If he ought to do it anyway, then it will not 
serve as a price for a new promise or agreement to 
discharge it. Another illustration of that may be 
given: Suppose a contractor agrees to build a house 
for $10,000; he gets sick of his job when he is about 
half through, says that it is not possible for him to 
make any money at that price and he is going to quit. 
"Well," the employer says, "if you will keep on I will 
give you a couple of thousand dollars more." Accor- 
dingly the builder keeps on. That won't do. The 
builder in keeping on building is doing no more than 
he was previously bound to do. If he wants to have 
a binding agreement for the extra $2,000 with his 
employer, he must secure a promise under seal, for his 
own promise of performance will not support the 
promise to pay. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 63 

FORBEARANCE AS CONSIDERATION.â€” 
Another kind of consideration that is worth calling 
attention to is forbearance. A has a valid claim 
against B. He says he is going to sue. B says if he 
won't sue, or won't sue for the present, B will pay 
him an agreed sum. That is a good contract so 
long as it is not open to the objection referred to a 
moment ago; that is, so long as A*S'claim is not for a 
liquidated sum of money and B's promise is not merely 
a promise to pay part of that liquidated sum. A may 
promise what B requests, either to forbear tempora- 
rily or to forbear perpetually. Either will be good. 
But suppose A has no valid claim against B, but B is 
reputed to be rather an easy mark in the community 
and A is a person of little scruple; he accordingly 
trumps up a claim against B with the hope of getting 
a compromise. Is forbearance of that claim by A good 
consideration for B's promise? It is not. A's claim 
must be a bona fide one in order to make surrender of 
it or the forbearance to press it, either temporarily or 
permanently, a good consideration for a promise of 
payment. 

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. â€” Another 
case of a promise relating to a subject of very fre- 
quent importance in commercial law, and law gener- 
ally, is a promise to pay a debt barred by the statute 
of limitations, and this occasion requires a preliminary 
word in regard to that statute. This statute prohibits 
the bringing of an action or a claim after the expira- 
tion of a certain period. It is a different period for 
different sorts of claims. Action on a judgment in 



64 COMMERCIAL LAW 

most States may be begun within twenty years after 
such judgment is rendered ; so in some States may an 
action on a contract under seal. On the other hand, 
ordinary contractual claims generally expire in six 
years. Claims in tort, that is, for injury to person 
or property, last even a shorter time, but the ordinary 
contractual statute of limitations is six years. The 
statute begins to run against a promissory note, or 
other contract, not from the time when it is made, but 
from the time when it is by its terms to be performed. 
A note made now, payable the first of January next, 
will not be barred until six years from the first of 
January, not six years from now; and if it was made 
payable in ten years, as a mortgage note might well 
be, the statute would not bar it for sixteen years. 

PROMISE TO PAY BARRED DEBT.â€” It has 
been held, though the reasons are not very easy to 
explain, that a new promise will revive a debt so far 
as the statute of limitations is concerned. There need 
be no consideration for such a promise other than the 
existence of the old indebtedness; that is said to be a 
sufficient consideration, although, of course, it can 
hardly be said to be given as a price for the new 
promise. Take a promissory note payable January 1, 
1905. If nothing happens, that is barred on January 
1, 1911, but if in 1911 or 1912 the maker says, in effect, 
'T know I owe that old note. I have not paid is, but 
I will pay it," he will be liable on that new promise, 
and the statute will begin to run again and run for six 
years from the making of that new promise. It is not 
enough that the debtor should admit that there was a 



COMMERCIAL LAW 65 

liability; he must promise to pay it in order to make 
himself liable. Suppose, instead of a new promise 
made after the statute had run in 1911 or 1912, the 
maker had said before the maturity of the note, we 
will say in the course of 1910, "Don't worry about 
that note, I shall pay it," that also will start the stat- 
ute running afresh. In other words, the new promise 
may be made before the maturity of the note, or be- 
fore the statute has completely run as well as after 
the statute has completely run. In either case the new 
promise will start a fresh liability and keep the note 
alive for six years from the time the new promise was 
made. Of course, if the new promise is made the day 
after maturity of the old obligation, the total effect 
will be simply to extend the time of the statute one 
day, because only one day of the six years had run at 
the time the new promise was made, and counting 
six years from the date of the new promise gives only 
one day more. 

PART PAYMENT OF BARRED DEBTS.â€” 
Not only will a new promise in express terms keep 
the statute of limitations from barring a claim, but 
any part payment will have the same effect, unless at 
the time the part payment is made some qualification 
is expressly stated. A debtor may say, "I will pay 
you this part of my debt, but this is all," and incur 
no further liability ; but a part payment without such 
a qualification starts the statute running afresh as 
to the balance of the debt. It is by these part pay- 
ments that notes are frequently kept alive for a long 
series of years. Interest payments are as effectual for 



66 COMMERCIAL LAW 

the purpose as payments on account of part of the 
principal. A new six years begins to run from each 
payment of interest. The debtor may, however, say, 
"I will pay you half this debt," or "I will pay you the 
debt in installments of $10 a month." Such promises 
are binding according to their terms, and do away 
with the statute of limitations to that extent, but they 
do not enable the creditor to recover anything more 
than the debtor promises. A question may be asked 
here which is frequently of importance regarding an 
outlawed note with a payment of interest thereon 
by the maker. Would an endorser who had waived 
demand and notice be liable for six years more? Yes, 
if the payment was made before the statute had com- 
pletely run in favor of the endorser. Otherwise, no. 
And if the endorser had not waived demand and 
notice, the statute could in no case be prolonged 
against him by any act of the maker. 

REVIVAL OF DEBTS DISCHARGED BY 
BANKRUPTCY OR VOIDABLE FOR IN- 
FANCY. â€” A somewhat similar sort of revival of an 
old obligation may occur where a debt is discharged 
in bankruptcy. If a discharged bankrupt promises to 
pay his indebtedness or makes a payment on account 
of it, it will revive his old obligation and he will be 
liable again. And, similarly, though one whom the 
law calls an infant (that is, a minor under the age of 
twenty-one) who incurs indebtedness prior to his 
majority, can avoid liability (unless the indebtedness 
was incurred for what are called necessaries, that is, 
food, clothing, shelter and things of that sort) ; yet 



COMMERCIAL LAW 67 

if he promises after he has become of age that he will 
pay these debts, from which he might escape, there- 
after he is liable. 

CONTRACTS WHICH MUST BE IN WRIT- 
ING. â€” There is, in some contracts, one other requi- 
site, besides those already mentioned, necessary to 
make them enforceable, and that is a writing. It has 
already been said that writing is not, as such, essen- 
tial to the validity of contracts, but there are excep- 
tional kinds of contracts which the law has required 
to be in writing for many years. This is by virtue of 
what is known as the "Statute of Frauds." This was 
passed in England in the year 1676, and is known as 
"Chapter 3, of the Statute of 29, Charles II." This 
statute was passed for the purpose of preventing 
frauds and perjuries which were particularly preva- 
lent at the time it was enacted. It is doubtful as to 
how much good the statute has accomplished. There 
is no question that in many cases it has caused fraud 
and perjury rather than prevented it. The statute, 
however, as passed in England, has been reenacted in 
practically every State in this country with slight 
modifications, and it is, therefore, a part of contract 
law to which attention must be given. Originally, 
the statute read as follows: "No action shall be 
brought (1) whereby to charge any executor or ad- 
ministrator upon any special promise to answer 
damages out of his own estate; (2) or whereby to 
charge the defendant upon any special promise to 
answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another 
person; (3) or to charge any person upon any agree- 



68 COMMERCIAL LAW 

ment made in consideration oÂ£ marriage; (4) or upon 
any contract or sale of lands, tenements, or heredita- 
ments, or any interest in or concerning them; (5) or 
upon any agreement that is not to be performed 
within the space of one year from the making thereof ; 
unless the agreement upon which such action shall 
be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof 
shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be 
charged therewith or some person thereunto by him 
lawfully authorized." A word of comment is neces- 
sary to explain the general import of these various 
sections. 

Section 1: An executor or administrator is ap- 
pointed to settle a deceased person's estate. He is not 
obliged to personally pay the debts of the deceased 
person out of his own pocket, if the estate is not suffi- 
cient. His liability is limited by the assets of the de- 
ceased, but if, in order to save the credit of the 
deceased or for any other reason, he chooses to prom- 
ise "to answer damages out of his own estate" that 
promise must be in writing. This is the situation re- 
ferred to by this section. 

Section 2 : This is a very important class and leads 
us to call attention to the distinction between a guar- 
anty and a contract somewhat similar. Suppose A 
writes to Jordan, Marsh Company : "Please sell B six 
good shirts and charge the same to my account." That 
is not a guaranty. A is in that case a purchaser just 
as much as if he ordered the shirts sent to himself. 
Nor is it any more a guaranty if it was further agreed 
h^fTxr^en A and B that B should pay A for the shirts 



COMMERCIAL LAW 69 

On the other hand, if A should write to Jordan, Marsh 
Company, "Let B have six shirts and if he doesn't 
pay, I will," then you would have a guaranty. It is of 
the essence of a guaranty that there should be a prin- 
cipal debtor and that the guarantor's liability should 
be only secondary. A guaranty must be in writing. 
To put the matter in another way, when there are 
three parties to a transaction like the above, the writ- 
ing is necessary. Where there are two parties, no 
writing is necessary. Where A says to Jordan, Marsh 
Company, "Let B have six shirts, and if he doesn't 
pay, I will," we have three parties: A, the guarantor; 
B, the principal debtor, and Jordan, Marsh Company, 
the creditor. This must be in writing. Where A says 
to Jordan, Marsh Company orally, "Give B six shirts 
and charge to my account," we have simply two par- 
ties, A, the principal debtor, and Jordan, Marsh Com- 
pany, the creditor. Hence no writing is necessary. In 
connection with this section, it must be kept in mind 
that some oral contracts which would be good under 
this section may not be enforceable under another 
section which we shall refer to later, because the 
amount involved is over a specified sum. 

Section 3: The agreement referred to by this sec- 
tion is not the contract or promise to marry, but is 
for a marriage settlement such as a promise to make 
a payment of money or a settlement of property in 
consideration of a marriage actually taking place. 

Section 4: Any contract for the sale of land, or 
any interest in or concerning land, requires a writing 
in order to make it binding. The commonest kind of 



70 COMMERCIAL LAW 

contracts in regard to land are leases or contracts for 
leases. An oral lease creates what is called a "tenancy 
at will," that is, the agreement, in so far as it specifies 
a fixed term, is wholly invalid, but while the tenant 
occupies he must pay at the agreed rate; but he has 
no right to stay in ; he may be turned out, even though 
he pays his rent promptly, on notice equal to the time 
between rent days ; and, similarly, he has a right to go 
out on giving the same short notice. 

Section 5: An agreement not to be performed 
within a year must be in writing, and this provision 
of the statute has been the subject of rather an odd 
construction by the courts. The words "not to be 
performed within a year" have been construed to 
mean "which cannot possibly be performed within a 
year." Suppose A hires B for a year from to-morrow 
and contrast with that case a promise to hire B for 
B's life, or for the promisor's life. Now the first of 
those bargains is within the statute and must be in 
writing, but the second, although it seems for a much 
longer period, being for the whole life of the promisor 
or promisee, is not within the statute. The man on 
whose death the promise depends may die within a 
year, so there is a possibility of performance within a 
year. A promise to employ B for all his life, since 
that may possibly be done within a year, need not 
be put in writing. But a promise to hire a man 
for a year from to-morrow cannot be performed in a 
year. True, he may die within a year, and then the 
contract cannot be enforced, but there will be no per- 
formance. What was agreed, by the parties, was ser- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 71 

vice for a year from to-morrow and that cannot pos- 
sibly be done earlier than a year from to-morrow. 

SALE OF GOODS.â€” A contract for the sale of 
goods exceeding in value a certain amount must also 
be in writing unless part or all of the goods have been 
delivered or part or all of the price paid. The value of 
the goods which brings a sale within this section of 
the Statute of Frauds varies in different States, and 
local statutes, therefore, should be consulted to ascer- 
tain the law in this connection. 

Besides the kinds of contracts enumerated in 
the English statute and which have generally been 
adopted in this country there are two or three other 
classes of contracts which in a number of States are 
required by statute to be in writing. Of this sort is 
a contract to make a will. That is not a very common 
sort of contract, but sometimes a man promises in 
consideration of certain services to make a will in 
another's favor. The possibility of fraud in such cases 
is considerable. The testator is always dead before 
the question comes up, and then if the alleged prom- 
isee were allowed to prove by oral statements a con- 
tract to bequeath the testator's property on terms 
which the promisee says were agreed upon between 
them, it would afford a chance to produce the same 
effect as if oral wills were allowed. So a contract of a 
real estate agent for commissions is in some States 
required to be in writing. A contract with an agent 
empowering him to sell real estate, though not re- 
garded at common law as within the prohibition of 
the section of the statute for the sale of an interest 



72 COMMERCIAL LAW 

in land to be in writing, is by special enactment in 
many States required to be in writing. A contract 
for a loan of money reserving a rate of interest higher 
than that ordinarily allowed by law is sometimes 
required to be in writing. 

WHAT CONSTITUTES WRITING. â€” The 
writing being a matter of proof, it is not essential 
that it be made at the time the contract is entered 
into. If made at any time before an action upon the 
contract is begun, that is a sufficient compliance with 
the statute. The writing, in order to be sufficient, 
must show who the parties to the agreement are, if 
not by naming them, by such a description as points 
to a specific person. Thus a letter addressed simply 
"Sir," and signed by the party charged, but not con- 
taining the name of the person addressed, is not suffi- 
cient. It is also required that all the terms of the 
contract appear in the writing, such as the subject 
matter, price, terms of credit or any express warranty, 
but, as often happens, they need not all be expressed 
in one writing. Contracts are frequently made as 
the result of an extended correspondence, and in such 
a case the various letters can be put together and con- 
strued as one writing if they obviously refer to one 
another, and thus all the terms appear in writing. The 
statutes in some States require "subscription" of the 
signature, and in that case the signing must be at the 
end ; but where there is not such requirement a sign- 
ing in the body of the instrument is sufficient. 

ALTERATION OF WRITTEN CONTRACT 
BY SPOKEN WORDS.â€” Failure to understand and 



COMMERCIAL LAW 73 

observe the rule restricting parol evidence to vary 
written contracts leads to a great deal of trouble. The 
parol evidence rule is this: Where parties have exe- 
cuted a written contract purporting to state the terms 
of their agreement, the court will not receive evidence 
that they orally agreed to something less or more or 
different, at or before the time when the written 
agreement was executed. That written agreement 
is taken as conclusive evidence of the contract made 
at that time. In trying to ascertain what the writing 
means, however, the court will permit the surround- 
ing circumstances to be shown, and the meaning 
of technical or trade terms or abbreviations may be 
proved. It may be shown also that the parties did 
not intend the written agreement to be effective 
until some particular event happened ; but if the writ- 
ing was executed as an expression of the intention of 
the parties at that time, the only endeavor of the court 
will be to ascertain the meaning of the written words 
and to enforce them as written. The question of oral 
agreements made subsequent to the writing is not so 
simple. We must here distinguish between (1) con- 
tracts of which the law requires written evidence 
because they are within the Statute of Frauds, and 
(2) contracts which the law does not require to be in 
writing, but which, nevertheless, are written. Con- 
tracts of the latter sort may be rescinded, added to 
or subtracted from by any subsequent agreement 
which conforms to the requirements of the law gov- 
erning mutual consent and consideration, though of 
course it is very desirable, to avoid dispute, that any 



74 COMMERCIAL LAW 

variation or rescission of a written contract should 
itself be in writing. If, however, the Statute of Frauds 
required the original contract to be in writing, though 
it may orally be rescinded, it cannot be varied by oral 
agreement. To permit such an oral agreement would 
in effect violate the Statute of Frauds by permitting 
an agreement partly in writing but partly oral to be 
enforced. Thus, if a written contract for the sale of 
goods (exceeding in value the amount permitted to 
be contracted for orally) was made, and the parties 
afterwards orally agreed to change the price, the time 
of delivery, or any other terms of the contract, the 
subsequent oral agreement would be invalid. 

THE LIMITS OF CONTRACTUAL RELA- 
TIONS. â€” As a general rule a contract does not im- 
pose liabilities or confer rights on a person v/ho is 
not a party to it. It follows from the very nature of 
a contract that a person who is not a party to it cannot 
be included in the rights or liabilities which it creates, 
so that he will be entitled to sue or render himself 
liable to be sued upon it. A contract is the result of a 
voluntary agreement entered into by the parties. 
Therefore, any contractual rights or liabilities exist- 
ing by virtue of such voluntary agreement between 
Smith and Jones are no concern of White and Black. 
They cannot be bound by any of the provisions of 
the contract between Smith and Jones, nor can a 
breach of that contract give them any rights. There 
are apparent exceptions to the rule we have just men- 
tioned. One is in the case of agency. Here one per- 
son represents another in entering into a contract. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 75 

A contract, however, made by an agent can bind a 
principal only by force of a previous authority or a 
subsequent ratification, so that really the contract 
v^hich binds the principal is his own contract. The 
other exception is where the rights and liabilities cre- 
ated by a contract may pass to a person other than the 
original party to it, either by act of the parties them- 
selves or by operation of law. Such would be the case 
where Smith and Jones have performed the terms of 
their contract except that Smith has not paid the 
agreed amount to Jones. Jones assigns his right to 
collect this amount to White. Such an assignment is 
permissible, as we will learn when we consider that 
subject later on. Such is an assignment by act of the 
parties themselves. Even this exception is limited, 
as the obligations incurred in purely personal service 
contracts are not subject to assignment. Thus, if I 
employ artist Greene to paint my portrait, he could 
not assign this contract and compel me to accept a 
portrait painted by artist Brown. 

THE RULE OF LAWRENCE v. FOX.â€” We 
shall now take up a very generally recognized excep- 
tion to the principle we have just discussed. The 
question in its simplest form is this: If Smith and 
Jones make a contract for the benefit of Greene, may 
Greene sue on that contract? From what we have 
said in the preceding paragraph a negative answer 
might seem to be correct. However, to-day, stated in 
general terms, and leaving out of the question the 
limitations recognized in various jurisdictions, the 
very general rule is that a third party (Greene in our 



76 COMMERCIAL LAW 

illustration) may enforce a promise made for his 
benefit, even though he is a stranger both to the con- 
tract and to the consideration. In other words, it 
is held not to be necessary that any consideration 
move from the third party. It is enough if there is a 
sufficient consideration betv^een the parties who make 
the agreement for the benefit of the third party. So 
in the leading case of Lawrence v. Fox, 20 New York 
268, where a debtor of the plaintiff had loaned money 
to the defendant and the defendant had promised him 
to pay the plaintiff, although the plaintiff was not a 
party to the contract, it was held that where a promise 
is "made to one for the benefit of another, he for whose 
benefit it is made may bring an action for its breach." 
QUALIFICATION OF RULE.â€” We must call 
attention to one qualification quite generally recog- 
nized. Under this rule, that a beneficiary may enforce 
a contract, it is necessary that the contract must have 
been intended for the benefit of a third person. It is 
not sufficient that the performance may just happen 
to benefit a third person ; it must have been intended 
for the benefit of a more or less definite person. Thus, 
where a county board had entered into a contract with 
a construction company which was building a bridge 
for it and maintaining a temporary foot bridge during 
the operation, by the terms of which contract the con- 
struction company assumed responsibility for all in- 
juries suffered by pedestrians using the temporary 
foot bridge, it was held that a person who was injured 
because of the failure to light the foot bridge properly, 
was not such a third person as might sue under the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 77 

rule of Lawrence v. Fox, on the contract made be- 
tween the county board and the construction com- 
pany. 

APPLICATION OF RULE.â€” The rule in Law- 
rence V. Fox has been applied to contracts under seal 
in many jurisdictions, although there are some deci- 
sions to the contrary. A common application of this 
doctrine is found in the sale of real property with a 
mortgage upon it. The new purchaser as a part of the 
purchase price makes an agreement whereby he as- 
sumes the payment of the mortgagee. The question of 
whether the mortgagee, who is really the third party 
for whose benefit the contract is made, may sue the 
new owner, is generally answered in the affirmative. 

CAPACITY OF PARTIES.â€” All persons are 
ordinarily presumed to be capable of contracting, but 
the law imposes upon some â€” in varying amounts and 
for their own protection â€” disabilities to make con- 
tracts which may be enforced against them ; and, upon 
some, for considerations of public policy, disabilities 
to make enforceable contracts. These persons are (1) 
Infants; (2) Insane persons; (3) Drunkards; (4) 
Married women â€” to a limited extent; (5) Aliens; 
(6) Artificial persons or corporations. 

WHO ARE INFANTS.â€” All persons under the 
age of twenty-one are considered infants, except that 
in some States, by statute, women attain their major- 
ity at eighteen. The law endeavors to protect those 
who have no experience and judgment against the 
loss of their property because of their inability to deal 
safely with others who might take an advantage of 



78 COMMERCIAL LAW 

that fact. It may well be that one who has nearly 
attained his majority is as able in fact to protect his 
interests as one of full age, but the essence of the law is 
that it is a rule of universal application, and the law 
cannot measure the ability in each particular case. To 
do the greatest good for the greatest number, there- 
fore, it conclusively presumes that those under 
twenty-one have not yet gained the ability to cope 
with others in the preservation of their property. 

CONTRACTS OF AN INFANT.â€” An infant's 
contracts are voidable; that is, though they bind the 
other party to the bargain the infant himself may 
avoid them. If he avoids them the adult with whom 
he contracted is entitled to recover whatever he may 
have given the infant which still remains in the lat- 
ter's possession; but if the infant has spent or used, 
or for any reason no longer has the consideration 
which the adult gave him, the infant may avoid his 
own obligation if he has not already performed it, and 
if he has already performed it he may reclaim what 
he has given. After he comes of age, but not before, 
the infant may ratify his contracts and they then be- 
come binding upon him. The retention after coming 
of age of property received by the infant during his 
minority amounts to a ratification. There are a few 
obligations of an infant which on grounds of public 
policy are binding upon him. This is true of a con- 
tract to perform military service. The marriage of 
an infant is binding though his engagement is not. 
It is frequently said that his contract for necessaries 
is binding; strictly this is not true. The infant is 



COMMERCIAL LAW 79 

liable for necessaries, but his obligation does not de- 
pend upon his contract; it is an obligation imposed 
by law â€” what has been called a quasi-contract. The 
importance of this distinction is shown if the price 
agreed upon exceeded the real value of the neces- 
saries. If the contract were binding, the infant would 
be bound to pay the agreed price, but in fact he is 
liable only for the fair value. What is necessary for 
an infant depends upon his station in life, upon 
whether he already has a sufficient supply of the nec- 
essary article in question, and upon whether he is 
receiving proper support from a parent or guardian. 
The privilege of an infant is generally held to exist 
even though the party dealing with him not only rea- 
sonably believed the infant of age, but had received 
actual representations from the infant to that effect. 
INSANE PERSONS AND DRUNKARDS.â€” 
The law affords protection to insane persons and, to 
a less extent, to drunkards, for the same reason as in 
the case of infants, namely, that those who are inca- 
pable of understanding what they are doing and of 
comprehending the effect of their contracts upon their 
property should be safeguarded against the designs 
of the more capable. This protection is given them by 
declaring some of their contracts void, and allowing 
them, or those legally representing them, to avoid all 
others with the exception of a few. Also, as in the 
case of infants, this privilege as to such contracts is 
for the insane person's protection only, and the other 
party to the contract may not avoid it by pleading 
that it was made with an incompetent person. 



80 COMMERCIAL LAW 

WHOM DOES THE LAW CONSIDER IN- 
SANE? â€” Modern science has clearly established that 
a person may be insane on one subject, and yet pos- 
sess a clear understanding and be perfectly sound on 
another. If the contract deals with a subject of which 
the person has a clear understanding, he is not in 
need of protection and is given none. Those only are 
given the protection who do not possess the mind to 
understand in a reasonable manner the nature and 
effect of the act in which they engage. 

BINDING OBLIGATIONS FOR NECES- 
SARIES. â€” The insane must live as well as the sane; 
consequently they are bound to pay for necessaries 
furnished them but only the reasonable value, as has 
been explained in the case of infants. The rules for 
determining what these necessaries may be are the 
same as in the case of infants. 

OTHER CONTRACTS.â€” It is often a difBcult 
matter to know when a person is insane, much more 
difficult than it is to determine a person's age. One 
of the contracting parties may have acted in perfect 
good faith, being ignorant of the other's unsound- 
ness of mind and having no judicial determination of 
insanity or other warning to put him on his guard. 
The contract even may be reasonable in its terms, and 
it may have been so acted upon that the parties to 
it cannot be restored to their original position. In 
such a case, while the law should protect the incom- 
petent, it would be clear injustice to protect him to 
such an extent as to make the other party suffer 
through no fault of his own. It has been quite gen- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 81 

erally determined in this country, therefore, that 
where a person does not know of the other's in- 
sanity and there has been no judicial determination 
of such insanity to notify the world of it, and the con- 
tract is a fair one, and has been so acted upon that the 
parties cannot be restored to their original position, 
it is binding upon the lunatic as well as upon the other 
party. 

VOID CONTRACTS.â€” In some States it is held, 
however, that all contracts of an insane person are 
void. In such States the rule above stated would not 
hold. The law of each State must be consulted to 
determine the law in the particular State. In some 
States, notably New York and Massachusetts, an in- 
sane person's deed of lands has been held to be void, 
without reference to whether or not the other party 
entered into the contract in good faith without notice, 
or that it has been so far acted upon that the parties 
cannot be restored to their original position. As in 
the case of infants, an insane person's power of attor- 
ney has been declared by high authority to be abso- 
lutely void. 

VOIDABLE CONTRACTS.â€” In most jurisdic- 
tions an insane person's contracts are voidable by him 
or by his guardian, provided (1) that the other person 
knew of his insanity at the time of making the con- 
tract, or (2) he had been declared insane by some 
court, or (3) the parties can be restored to their orig- 
inal position. 

RATIFICATION AND AVOIDANCE.â€” 
When the insane person's reason has been restored. 



82 COMMERCIAL LAW 

if the contract is a voidable one, as explained in the 
foregoing rules, though he may by acts or words avoid 
the contract he made during his insanity, he may in 
like manner ratify it, or he may ratify it by not avoid- 
ing it within a reasonable time after recovering his 
reason while continuing to keep something capable 
of being returned, which he obtained under the con- 
tract. 

WHAT CONSTITUTES DRUNKENNESS.â€” 
It is not ordinary drunkenness which excuses a man 
from his contracts, and enables him to claim the pro- 
tection given generally to incapable persons. The 
person must have been utterly deprived of his reason 
and understanding, so that he could not comprehend 
the nature or effect of the act in which he was en- 
gaged. That he was so much under the influence of 
liquor that his judgment was not as good as in his 
normal state does not excuse him. 

MARRIED WOMEN.â€” It is practically impos- 
sible to state in brief form the law upon the subject of 
married women's contracts. The difficulty arises from 
the diverse changes made in the plain and clear rules 
of the common law by statutes in the different States. 
The old law is wholly incompatible with the enlight- 
ened view now held in regard to women, their family, 
social and business standing, and the changes have 
been made to give them the rights to which they are 
justly entitled. But, inasmuch as the statutes have 
not been uniform in the different States, the law 
to-day is not wholly uniform. The statutes and deci- 
sions in each State must be consulted to determine 



COMMERCIAL LAW 83 

the law on the subject as it is to-day. Through these 
changes the law has become very complicated, and 
business men should obtain legal advice before enter- 
ing into important business dealings with married 
women. 

THE OLD RULE.â€”Upon her marriage a 
woman's existence became merged in that of her 
husband, and the husband and wife were regarded 
for many purposes as one person. What tangible 
personal property she had became his immediately 
upon marriage, and he had the right to reduce her 
bills, notes, bonds and other debts to his posses- 
sion. Her real property she retained the title to, 
subject to the right of the husband to have the use 
of it during his life, if children were born of the mar- 
riage. He was bound to supply her with necessaries, 
and so long as he did this her contracts for things 
of even ordinary use were void; but if he failed to 
supply the necessaries her contract for them would 
be valid. All her other contracts were absolutely void 
â€” not voidable. Her position, then, was worse than 
an infant's. She could have personal property of her 
own only if it was given to someone else to hold the 
title and pay over the income to her, and even this 
"separate estate," as it was called, could not be bound 
by her contracts. 

CHANGES MADE BY STATUTE.â€” The law 
of married women's contracts has been greatly 
changed by legislative enactments, to give married 
women the rights which the more enlightened view 
of the present time accords to them. The first changes 



84 COMMERCIAL LAW 

aimed quite generally to give her greater rights over 
her "separate estate," giving her pov^er to make bind- 
ing contracts v^^ith reference to it, or to make binding 
contracts if she were carrying on a trade or business 
of her own. But the earlier statutes frequently did 
not give her power to contract with her husband, or 
to make binding contracts if she had no separate 
estate, or was not carrying on a separate business. 
Later enactments have largely corrected these de- 
fects, but the old rule still stands except as it has been 
changed by statute, and, therefore, the statutes of 
each State and the decisions interpreting them must 
be consulted to determine accurately the law in each 
State. It may, however, be said that generally a 
married woman may now contract except with her 
husband, and except as surety for him. In many 
States she can even make contracts of these excepted 
classes. 

ALIENS. â€” An alien is one born out of the juris- 
diction of the United States, of a father not a citizen 
of this country, and who has not been naturalized. 
In times of peace, aliens may hold property and make 
contracts and seek the protection of our courts as 
freely as citizens. When war breaks out between 
this country and another the making of contracts 
between citizens of the two countries is prohibited. 
If such contracts are made during a state of war, they 
are illegal and void, and the courts of this country 
will not lend their aid to enforce them, either during 
the war or after its termination. Contracts made 
before the war breaks out are good, but cannot be 



COMMERCIAL LAW 85 

enforced, nor can remedies for their breach be ob- 
tained, while the war is in progress. When the war 
ceases, however, the courts will lend their aid to the 
enforcement of such contracts. 

CORPORATIONS.â€” A corporation may con- 
tract as freely as an individual so long as its con- 
tracts are within the business powers and scope of 
the business which its charter authorizes it to con- 
duct. And even if a corporation has made a con- 
tract outside of the scope of its business, and the 
contract has been acted upon so that either party 
has had the benefit of the contract, an action 
will lie in favor of the other for the benefits so 
conferred. But a contract outside of the business 
which its charter permits the corporation to engage 
in, and which is wholly executory, the courts will not 
enforce. Such contracts are said to be ultra vires. 
Contracts with a corporation may be in the same 
form as contracts between individuals, and the cor- 
poration need use its seal only where an ordinary 
person is required to use one. The officer or officers 
making the contract on behalf of a corporation must, 
however, be authorized so to do either by the directors 
or by the general powers attached to such officers. 
In law corporations are deemed to be artificial per- 
sons subject in a general way to provisions governing- 
natural persons. 



CHAPTER III 



Contracts â€” Performance and 
Termination 

PRIMARY RULE.â€” After a contract has been 
formed, it does not make much difference 
whether it is under seal or whether it is a simple 
contract ; the rules governing the contract, subsequent 
to its formation, are very much the same though there 
are a few distinctions. The primary rule running 
through the law, governing obligations to perform 
contracts, is that if a man has once formed a good 
contract he must do as he agreed, and if he fails sub- 
stantially (not merely slightly) to do so the other 
party may refuse to perform on his part. If you re- 
member that fundamental principle you cannot gen- 
erally go far wrong. 

CONDITIONAL CONTRACTS â€” INSUR- 
ANCE. â€” What one agrees to often depends on the 
conditions which he includes as part of his promise. 
Take the insurance policy previously alluded to. An 
insurance company promises to pay $5,000, but it 
does not promise to pay in any event; the condition 
"if the house burns down" is obviously a qualification 
of the promise. But there are other conditions in the 
insurance policy. The insurance company says that 
it will not be liable if gasoline is kept in the house 
beyond a small quantity necessary for cleaning. That, 
too, is a condition of its promise to pay $5,000; so that 

86 



COMMERCIAL LAW 87 

"if the house burns down," "if gasoline is not kept 
in the house," "if the house is not unoccupied more 
than three months," and "if mechanics are not al- 
lowed in possession of the property for more than a 
certain length of time," are all conditions, and the 
company's main promise need only be kept if the con- 
ditions are complied with. That is why an insurance 
policy is not always quite as good as it seems â€” be- 
cause there is a large promise in large print ; but there 
are a good many qualifications in smaller print which 
are really part of the promise and must be taken into 
account. 

CONDITIONS IN BUILDING CONTRACTS. 
â€” Another kind of conditional promise often occurs 
in building contracts. The employer agrees to pay 
the builder or contractor on the production of an 
architect's certificate. Now it doesn't do the builder 
any good to build that house unless he gets the archi- 
tect's certificate, for he has been promised pay only 
on condition that he produce it. That is the promise 
between the parties. That is the only promise. 

WHEN PERFORMANCE OF CONDITIONS 
IS EXCUSED. â€” It is obvious that these conditions 
in promises may be sometimes used to defeat the ends 
of justice, and undoubtedly at times they are so used. 
A person who draws a contract cleverly will put in a 
great many conditions qualifying his own liability, 
and will try to make the promise on the other side as 
unconditional as possible. The law cannot wholly do 
away with these conditions, because in general, so 
long as parties do not make illegal bargains, they have 



88 COMMERCIAL LAW 

a right to make such bargains as suit themselves. The 
court cannot make their agreement for them, but it is 
held that if a condition will lead to a real forfeiture 
by an innocent promisee, the law will relieve the 
promisee. Thus, in the architect's certificate case, if 
the house was properly built and it was merely ill 
temper on the part of the architect that caused him 
to withhold giving the certificate, the court would 
allow the builder to recover, and even if the architect 
had some good reason for refusing the certificate, the 
court would not allow the builder to be permanently 
prevented from recovering anything on the contract, 
providing the builder had substantially though not 
entirely performed his contract and had acted in good 
faith. If, however, his default was wilful, if he had 
tried to beat the specifications, and the architect had 
found him out and therefore refused the certificate, 
the only thing the builder could do would be to go at 
it again, tear out his faulty construction and build as 
he had agreed. 

IN CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT, 
WORK MUST BE PERFORMED BEFORE PAY- 
MENT IS DUE.â€” There are other matters which 
qualify the obligation of a promisor to perform be- 
sides express conditions such as those we have alluded 
to. Take this case: John promises to work for the 
A. B. Company; the A. B. Company promises to em- 
ploy him and to pay him a salary of $1,000 a year. 
John comes to work the first day and works a while, 
and then he says he would like his thousand dollars. 
The A. B. Company says, "Well, you have got to do 



COMMERCIAL LAW 89 

your work first." John says, "Why should I work 
first and trust you for pay, rather than you pay first 
and trust me for the work? I will keep on working, 
but I want the pay now." Of course, the employer is 
right in refusing to pay until the work has been done, 
even though the promise of the employer is not ex- 
pressly qualified by the statement that after the work 
has been done he will pay $1,000. It has been dictated 
by custom, rather than by anything else, that where 
work is to be performed on one side and money to be 
paid on the other, in the absence of any statement in 
the contract to the contrary, the work must be done 
before the pay is given. The result is this : that John 
must work anyway, his promise to work being abso- 
lute ; but the employer's promise to pay the money is, 
in effect, conditional. It is subject to an implied con- 
dition, as it is called, that John shall have done the 
work he agreed to do. The promise of the employer 
is, in effect, "I will pay if you previously have done 
the work." But John's promise is absolute: "I will 
work." He has to trust for the pay. 

PERFORMANCE FIRST DUE UNDER A 
CONTRACT MUST BE GIVEN BEFORE PER- 
FORMANCE SUBSEQUENTLY DUE FROM 
THE OTHER PARTY CAN BE DEMANDED.â€” 
And that case is an illustration of a broader principle 
which may be stated in this way : where the perform- 
ance promised one party to a contract is to precede in 
time the performance by the other side, the party who 
is to perform first is bound absolutely to perform; 
whereas the party who is to perform subsequently 



90 COMMERCIAL LAW 

may refuse to perform unless and until the other party 
performs. In the cases thus far alluded to, the prom- 
ises of the two parties could not be performed at the 
same time. You cannot work for a year and pay $1,000 
simultaneously. One performance takes a whole year 
and the other performance takes only a moment. 

PERFORMANCES CONCURRENTLY DUE. 
â€” But frequently there arise cases where both prom- 
ises can take place at the same time. The commonest 
illustration of that is a contract to buy and sell. You 
can pay the price and hand over the goods simultane- 
ously, and when a contract is of this character, that 
is, where both performances can be rendered at the 
same time, the rule is that in the absence of agree- 
ment to the contrary, they must be performed simul- 
taneously. John agrees to buy James' horse and pay 
$200 for it, and James agrees to sell the horse for 
$200 ; that is a bilateral contract of purchase and sale. 
Now suppose neither party does anything, has each 
party broken his promise? It might seem so, for John 
has not bought the horse or paid for it as he agreed, 
nor has James sold the horse. But where each party 
is bound to perform simultaneously with the other, 
if either wants to acquire any rights under the con- 
tract he must do what is called putting the other party 
in default, that is, he must offer to perform himself. 
John, therefore, must go to James, offer $200 and de- 
mand the horse if he wants to assert that James has 
broken his contract. And James, on the other hand, 
if he wishes to enforce the contract, must go with the 
horse to John and say, "Here is the horse which I 



COMMERCIAL LAW 91 

will hand over to you on receiving simultaneously the 
$200 which you promised me for it." The obligation 
of the two promises when they can be performed 
simultaneously is called concurrently conditional, 
that is, each party has a concurrent right to perform- 
ance by the other, and has a right to refuse perform- 
ance until he receives, concurrently with his own per- 
formance, performance by the other party. 

INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS.â€” Sometimes 
contracts are more complicated than those which we 
have stated, such as contracts of service and contracts 
to buy and sell. This, for instance, is a type of a very 
common sort of contract in business : a leather manu- 
facturer uses large quantities of tanning extract in 
his tannery. He makes a contract for a regular sup- 
ply, so many barrels each week for a year, for which 
he agrees to pay a specified price a barrel on delivery. 
For a time the extract promised him is sent just as 
agreed. We will suppose, then, that perhaps the ex- 
tract manufacturer is slow in sending what he prom- 
ised ; there is a delay ; perhaps the extract that is fur- 
nished is not as good as it was or as the contract 
called for. What can the leather manufacturer do 
about it? Of course, he can keep on with the contract, 
taking what the extract manufacturer sends him, get- 
ting as much performance as he can, and then sue for 
such damages as he may suffer because of the failure 
to give what was promised completely. But he does 
not always want to do that. Suppose it is necessary 
for his business that he should get tanning extract 
and get it regularly. He does not want to wait and 



92 COMMERCIAL LAW 

take chances on the extract manufacturer's delays in 
delivery and inferiorities in quality. He wants to 
make a contract with somebody else and get out of 
his bargain with the first extract manufacturer alto- 
gether. May he do so? No question in contracts 
comes up in business more often than that. And the 
answer to the question is this: it depends on the ma- 
teriality of the breach, taking into consideration the 
terms of the contract and the extent of the default. 
Is the breach so serious as to make it fair and just in 
a business sense to call the contract wholly off; or 
will justice be better obtained by making the injured 
party keep on with the contract and seek redress in 
damages for any minor default? 

MATERIALITY OF BREACH IN CON- 
TRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT.â€” The same thing 
comes up very often in contracts of employment. Sup- 
pose an employer hires an employee for a year, and 
in the course of the year the employee at some time 
or other fails to fulfill his contractual duty as an em- 
ployee. He is negligent and in some respect fails to 
comply with his contract to render good and efficient 
service. Can the employer discharge him? We must 
ask how serious is the breach. A merely negligent 
breach of duty is not so serious as one which is wilful. 
Or the breach might be on the other side of the con- 
tract. Suppose the employer has promised to pay a 
certain sum each month as salary during the year, 
and does not pay promptly. Has the employee a 
right to say, "You pay my salary on the first day of 
of the month as you agreed, or I leave" ? No, he does 



COMMERCIAL LAW 93 

not have a right to speak so positively as that. A 
single day's delay in the payment of one month's in- 
stalment of salary would not justify throwing up a 
year's contract. On the other hand, if the delay ran 
along for any considerable time, it would justify the 
employee in refusing to continue. You will see that 
this principle of materiality of the breach on one side, 
as justifying a refusal to perform on the other, is 
rather an indefinite one. It involves questions of de- 
gree. That is so in the nature of the case. The indefi- 
niteness of the rule, therefore, cannot very well be 
helped. 

ILLUSTRATIONS AND DISTINCTIONS.â€” 
A few concrete illustrations may help to bring out the 
points under discussion. Suppose an agreement for 
the sale of real estate, and, for instance, the buyer is 
unable to be on hand the day the sale is to be com- 
pleted, and the owner is present, and, finding the buyer 
absent, immediately sells the land to another. Now is 
there any action against the owner, or might he justly 
refuse to go on with the contract because of the mo- 
mentary breach of contract? No, he cannot refuse to 
go on in the case of a contract of that sort to sell real 
estate, unless the contract very expressly provided 
that the transaction must be carried through at the 
specified time and place or not at all. The case would 
be governed otherwise by the principle of materiality 
of the breach, to which we have alluded. A brief delay 
would not be a sufficiently material breach to justify 
the seller in refusing to go on, but a long delay, of 
course, would be sufficient. In sales of personal prop- 



94 COMMERCIAL LAW 

erty time is regarded by the law as more important 
than in sales of land. In contracts to sell stocks vary- 
ing rapidly in value, time is a very important element. 
Suppose now that an option for a piece of land was 
given by the .owner. May he dispose of the land 
to another a few minutes after the time specified in 
the option for the acceptance of the offer? That is 
different from the case previously put. The option is 
in effect an offer to make a sale, and the offer is by 
its terms to expire, we will say, at 12 o'clock, noon, 
October 23. It will expire at that time, and an accep- 
tance a minute later will be too late. The difference 
is in the terms of the promise made by the different 
parties. In the case put first, there is an unqualified 
contract to buy and sell. In the case now put there is 
a promise to sell only if the price is tendered or if ac- 
ceptance is made prior to 12 o'clock, noon, October 
23. The terms of the option, assuming in its favor 
that it was given for consideration or was under seal 
and therefore not merely a revocable offer, were ex- 
pressly conditional. The vital thing in contracts is to 
be sure of the terms of your promise. The term option 
indicates a right v/hich exists up to a certain point; 
beyond that point there is no right. 

PROSPECTIVE INABILITY OF ONE 
PARTY EXCUSES THE OTHER.â€” There is one 
other thing besides actual breach by his co-contractor, 
which justifies one party to a contract in refusing to 
go on with the contract, and that may be called pro- 
spective inability to perform on the part of the other 
side. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 95 

INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY.â€” Let us 
give one or two illustrations of that. You have entered 
into a contract to sell a merchant 100 barrels of flour 
on thirty days' credit. The time has come for the de- 
livery of the flour, but the merchant is insolvent. He 
says to you, "I want you to deliver that flour; the 
agreed day has come." You say, "But you cannot pay 
for the flour." "Well," he replies, "it is not time to 
pay for it. You agreed to give me thirty days' credit : 
perhaps I shall be able to pay all right then. I have 
not broken my promise yet, and as long as I am not 
in default in my promise you have no right to break 
yours." You have a right to refuse to deliver the flour 
because, though the buyer has not yet broken his con- 
tract, the prospect of his being able to keep it, in view 
of his insolvency, is so slight that his prospective in- 
ability to perform in the future, when the time comes, 
excuses you from going on now. Insolvency or bank- 
ruptcy of one party to a contract will always excuse 
the other party from giving credit or going on with 
an executory contract, unless concurrent performance 
is made by the insolvent party or security given for 
future performance. 

REPUDIATION. â€” Repudiation of a contract 
by one party is also a good excuse. Repudiation means 
a wrongful assertion by one party to a contract that 
he is not going to perform in the future what he 
agreed. After such repudiation the other party may 
say, "I am not going to perform now what I agreed to 
perform, since you have said you will not perform in 
the future what you agreed. I shall not go ahead and 



96 COMMERCIAL LAW 

trust you, even though I did by the contract agree to 
give you credit, in view of the fact that you have now 
repudiated your agreement by saying that you are not 
going to do what you agreed." Repudiation may be 
indicated by acts as well as by words, and often is 
indicated partly by words and partly by acts. 

TRANSFER OF PROPERTY TO WHICH 
THE CONTRACT RELATES.â€” Still another illu- 
stration of prospective inability arises where a con- 
tract relates to specific property, as a certain piece 
of land, and before the time for performance comes, 
the owner of the land, who had agreed to sell it we will 
suppose, transfers it to somebody else or mortgages it. 
The man who had agreed to buy that piece of land 
may withdraw from the contract. He may say, "You 
might get the land back at the time you agreed to per- 
form, but I am not going to take any chances on that. 
I am off the bargain altogether." 

IMPORTANCE OF EXACT PROVISIONS 
IN CONTRACTS.â€” So much for the rather difficult 
subject of the mutual duties of parties to a contract in 
the performance of it. The best way to avoid doubt 
or uncertainty in such matters is to provide very ex- 
actly in the contract what the rights of the parties 
shall be in certain contingencies. The law always 
respects the intention of the parties when it is mani- 
fested, and it is only when they have said nothing 
about their intention that the rules which we have con- 
sidered become important. 

FRAUD. â€” The next question in regard to con- 
tracts arises out of certain grounds of defense that 



COMMERCIAL LAW 97 

may come up and the most important of these is 
fraud. Fraud is deception; it is inducing the other 
party to believe something which is not true, and, by 
inducing him to believe that, influencing his action. 
The ordinary way in which fraud is manifested is 
by misrepresentations. A purchase or sale of stock 
or of goods may be induced by fraud. A loan may be 
obtained from a bank by fraud, that is, by misrepre- 
sentation of material facts which influence the other 
side to act. 

MISSTATEMENTS OF OPINION ARE NOT 
FRAUDULENT. â€” Now what kind of misrepresenta- 
tion amounts to fraud? There must be misrepre- 
sentation of a fact. Merely misrepresentation of 
opinion is insufficient and what is opinion and what is 
fact has been the basis of a good many lawsuits. John 
offers his horse to James for sale at $300. He says that 
it is the best horse in town. Well, it is not the best 
horse in town by a good deal, but that sort of state- 
ment cannot be the basis of an allegation of fraud. 
That a thing is "good," or "the best in the market," or 
similar general statements, all of which ought to be 
known to the hearer to be simply expressions of 
opinion, are not statements of positive fact. Take 
these two statements in regard to the horse. "He can 
trot very fast." That is a mere statement of opinion. 
To some minds eight miles an hour is very fast; to 
more enterprising persons fifteen miles an hour is 
necessary in order to make travel seem fast. Those 
are matters of opinion. But a statement that the horse 
can trot twelve miles an hour, or has trotted one mile 



98 COMMERCIAL LAW 

in three minutes on the track, are statements of fact, 
and if untrue are fraudulent. A statement of value is 
a statement of opinion and cannot be the basis of 
fraud. A statement that the horse is worth $300, or is 
worth twice as much as the owner is asking for him, 
cannot be relied upon; but a statement that $300 was 
paid for this horse, or was offered for him, is an asser- 
tion of fact, and if untrue would be the basis of an 
allegation of fraud. 

PROMISES ARE NOT FRAUDULENT BE- 
CAUSE BROKEN. â€” A promise is not a statement of 
fact. A man may promise to do something and fail to 
carry out the promise, and in consequence the person 
he was dealing with may regret the bargain he en- 
tered into, but his only remedy is to sue for dam- 
ages for breach of the promise if it was part of a 
contract. He cannot assert that merely because the 
promise was not kept the transaction was fraudulent. 
But if a man makes a promise knowing when he makes 
it that he cannot keep it, he is committing a fraud. 
The commonest illustration of this is where a man 
buys goods on credit, having at the time an intention 
not to pay for them, or well knowing that he cannot 
pay for them. 

STATEMENTS MUST HAVE BEEN CAL- 
CULATED TO INDUCE ACTION.â€” Generally 
speaking, the statement relied on as fraudulent must 
have been made with the purpose of inducing action. 
For instance, suppose John likes to tell large stories. 
He tells James things about his neighbor's horse. 
John does not do this for any purpose except to brag 



COMMERCIAL LAW 99 

about living near a man who has such a splendid 
horse, but James suddenly takes the notion he would 
like to have that horse and he goes and buys it. Now 
it was not legal fraud on John's part to tell those 
lies about the horse, even though they did induce 
James to go and buy it, unless John, as a reasonable 
man, ought to have known that James was likely to 
buy the horse, as might have been the case if James 
had been talking about buying him. Then it would 
be fraud, and it would not make any difference in 
regard to its being fraudulent that John had nothing 
to gain by telling these lies, that he was simply doing 
it for the fun of the thing. 

REMEDIES FOR FRAUD.â€” What remedy 
has the defrauded person? The law gives him two 
rem.edies of which he may take his choice; he can- 
not have both, but he can have either. One is to sue 
the fraudulent person for such damages as have been 
suffered, and the other is to rescind the transaction, 
to get back what has been given, or to refuse to go on 
with the contract at all if it is still wholly executory. 

DURESS AND UNDUE INFLUENCE.â€” 
There are certain defences similar to fraud ; duress, or 
undue influence, is one of them. However, this is 
comparatively rare. It is compelling a person to do 
what he does not want to do, making him agree to a 
bargain that he would not agree to accept under com- 
pulsion, as by fear of personal violence or imprison- 
ment; and a bargain made under these circumstances 
can be rescinded or set aside. Merely threatening to 
enforce your legal rights by suit against another is not 



100 COMMERCIAL LAW 

duress, though it may in fact induce him to agree to 
what he would not otherwise have agreed; but to 
threaten criminal prosecution as a means of extorting 
money or inducing an agreement is illegal and in many 
jurisdictions is itself a crime. 

MISTAKE OF FACT.â€” In certain cases, also, 
a mutual mistake of a vital fact is ground for setting 
aside a contract, but these cases are not very com- 
mon. Mistakes generally do not prevent the enforce- 
ment of contracts. Usually where there is a mistake, 
it is of a character for which one party or the other 
is to blame. If the mistake arises out of deception 
it is fraud. If the mistake arises simply because the 
mistaken party has failed to inform himself of the 
facts, as he might have done, then it is no defence at 
all. But if both parties were acting under the mutual 
assumption that some vital fact was true in making 
a bargain, either one of them may avoid or rescind 
the bargain when it appears they were both mistaken. 

IMPOSSIBILITY.â€” Impossibility is sometimes 
a defence to the performance of a contract. Perhaps 
the simplest illustration of this arises in a contract 
for personal services of any kind. Illness or death 
of the person who promises the services excuses per- 
formance. Death does not usually terminate a con- 
tract or serve as a defence to it. If a man contracts 
to sell 100 bushels of grain and dies the next day his 
estate is liable on the contract just as if he continued 
alive; but if he agreed to hire a man as an employee 
for a year, his death or the employee's death within 
the year would terminate the obligation of both. Un- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 101 

expected difficulty is not impossibility. For instance, 
take a building contract : the builder agrees to put up 
a building within a certain time; he is prevented by 
strikes. Nevertheless, he is liable for not doing as 
he agreed. He should have put a condition in his 
promise, qualifying his agreement to build, that if 
strikes prevented, he would not be liable. So, if the 
foundation gave way and the building tumbled down 
before it was finished, the builder must put it up again. 
Also, if lightning struck it, he must put it up again. 

ILLEGAL CONTRACTS.â€” One other matter 
to be considered in connection with contracts and 
defences to them is illegality. Some kinds of illegal 
contracts are so obviously illegal that it is not neces- 
sary to say anything about them. Anybody would 
know that they were illegal and that they could not 
be enforced for that reason. A contract to steal or 
murder or take part in any crime is a good example. 
But other kinds of illegal contracts are not so ob- 
viously wicked as to make it clear that they are unen- 
forceable. It may be worth while to mention a few 
of these kinds of illegality. 

CONTRACTS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE. 
â€” One class of contracts which has become very im- 
portant in late years in business is the contract in 
restraint of trade, so called. The original contracts 
in restraint of trade were contracts by which one 
man agreed that he would not thereafter exercise his 
trade or profession, the object generally being that 
the promisee should be freed from the competition 
of the man who had promised to refrain from exercis- 



102 COMMERCIAL LAW 

ing his trade; and the law became settled a good 
many years ago that if the promise was general not to 
exercise the trade or profession anywhere, or at any 
time, it was illegal, but that if it was only for a reason- 
ably limited space of time it would not be illegal. 
That old law still exists, but there has grown up 
further a much more important class of cases where 
contracts are made to further an attempted monop- 
oly, and one may say pretty broadly that all such at- 
tempts are illegal. It does not matter how much 
business reason there is for it ; any attempt to combine 
in order to get a monopoly, or in order to put up prices, 
is bad. Moreover, if the attempted restraint of trade or 
monopoly concerns interstate commerce, the agree- 
ment is a Federal crime under the Sherman law. 

GAMBLING CONTRACTS.â€” Another kind of 
illegal contract is a gambling contract. This seems 
obvious in agreements for the more extreme kinds of 
gambling, but in certain business transactions where 
the matter becomes important, the dividing line is not 
so clear; especially in dealings on stock exchanges and 
exchanges for sales of staple products, such as grain, 
cotton and coffee. The stock exchanges and other 
exchanges are made the means of a great deal of 
speculation, which is virtually gambling. Now, in 
what cases does the law regard these transactions as 
gambling and, therefore unenforceable, and in what 
cases are they legal? The answer is, if an actual deliv- 
ery of the stock, or commodity bought, is contem- 
plated, then the transaction is not gambling in the 
legal sense ; but if a settlement merely of the differences 



COMMERCIAL LAW 103 

in buying and selling prices is contemplated, as the 
only performance of the bargain, then the transaction 
is gambling. The difference is between a stock-ex- 
change business and a bucket-shop business. If you 
give an order to a stock-exchange house to buy stock, 
even though you put up but a small margin and could 
put up but a small margin, and the stock-exchange 
house knows you could put up but a small margin, 
nevertheless, the stock-exchange house actually buys 
that stock, and it is delivered to it. The stock-ex- 
change house would then have a right to demand of 
you that you pay for that stock in full and take de- 
livery of it, and could sue you for the price if you failed 
to comply with the demand. However, as a matter 
of fact, it does not ordinarily do that. If it wants to 
get the price which you promised to pay, and you 
fail on demand to take up the stock, it sells the stock 
which it has been holding as security. The bucket- 
shop, on the other hand, though it takes your order 
to buy, does not actually buy the stock; it simply 
settles with you when you want to settle, or when it 
wants to settle, because the margin is not sufficiently 
kept good, by calculating the difference between the 
price at which the stock was supposedly bought and 
the price at which it is supposedly sold, those prices 
being fixed by the ruling market quotations at the 
time. It would be perfectly possible to make a gam- 
bling transaction out of the stock-exchange transac- 
tion by a very slight change. If a stock-exchange 
house should agree, for instance, that the customer 
should not be compelled to take delivery of the stock. 



104 COMMERCIAL LAW 

then that added agreement would make the transac- 
tion between broker and customer a gambling transac- 
tion, even though the broker actually bought the stock 
on the exchange, and, as between himself and the 
other broker on the exchange with whom he dealt, 
there was a perfectly valid sale of the stock. In some 
jurisdictions, by statute, speculative contracts which 
are not gambling contracts at common law are made 
illegal. 

BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES.â€” An- 
other very important class of illegal transactions 
arises from breach of fiduciary duties. A fiduciary 
is rather hard to define. He is somebody that owes 
a duty higher than a mere contractual obligation, a 
duty involving something of trust and confidence. A 
trustee is a fiduciary, so is an agent. A director or 
officer of a corporation is a fiduciary, and any dealing 
in which a fiduciary violates his duty to the person 
for whom he is fiduciary is illegal, and any agreement 
for such a violation is an illegal contract. It is illegal 
for a trustee to bargain for any advantage from his 
trust other than his regular compensation. It would 
be illegal for a trustee to bargain with a bank to give 
the bank a trust account in return for some personal 
advantage, as a loan to be made to the trustee per- 
sonally. It would be a breach of fiduciary duty for a 
corporation officer and director to bargain for any per- 
sonal advantage by virtue of his official action. 

KNOWLEDGE OF ANOTHER'S ILLEGAL 
PURPOSE.-â€” The knowledge of another's illegal 
purpose will not make the person who knows of it 



COMMERCIAL LAW 105 

himself guilty of illegality ; but if one not only knows 
but in any way promotes the illegal purpose of an- 
other, he will be considered a party to the illegality. 
A may sell goods to B, knowing that B is going to 
use them illegally, and A's sale will not be illegal; 
but if A does anything to help B in using them il- 
legally, or if the goods are of such a character that 
they can be used only illegally, then A would be 
guilty of illegality himself. 

MEANING OF ASSIGNMENTS.â€” Much of 
the difficulty regarding assignment of contracts is 
due to different meanings which may be attached to 
the word assignment. When property is assigned 
the assignee becomes the owner in every sense, if the 
person from whom he took the assignment had a valid 
title. This is not true of the assignment of contracts. 
By the common law, contract rights or "choses in 
action," as they are termed in law, were not assign- 
able, the reason being that one who contracted with 
A, cannot without his consent become bound to B. 

POWER OF ATTORNEY TO COLLECT A 
CLAIM. â€” Though when a man had a contract right 
he could not by common law make B in a complete 
sense the owner of the claim, he could give B a power 
to collect the claim as his, A's, agent, and authorize 
him to keep the proceeds when the claim was col- 
lected. It long ago became established that when an 
owner of a claim purported to make an assignment of 
a claim he thereby gave the assignee the power to en- 
force the claim in his stead, and this power given the 
assignee is irrevocable. 



106 COMMERCIAL LAW 

EFFECT OF ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS.â€” 
It may be supposed that the effect of an assignment 
of a right, though the result may be worked out by 
treating the assignee as an agent or attorney of the 
assignor, is the same as if the assignee were fully 
substituted in the position of the assignor as owner 
of the claim, but this is not quite true. Assum- 
ing that the claim is not represented by negotiable 
paper, the legal owner of the claim is still the as- 
signor. This is shown by the fact that if the debtor 
pays the assignor in ignorance of the assignment, the 
debt is discharged and the assignee can only go 
against his assignor for the latter's fraudulent con- 
duct in collecting the claim after having assigned it. 
So, too, if the assignor makes a subsequent assign- 
ment, this subsequent assignee also has a power of 
attorney to collect the claim and keep the proceeds; 
so that if the second assignee in good faith collects 
the claim in ignorance of the prior assignment, he 
can keep what he has collected; nor is the debtor 
liable to the first assignee who must as before seek 
redress from his assignor. It is, therefore, always 
important for the assignee of a non-negotiable chose 
in action to give immediate notice of his assignment 
to the debtor. If after such notice the debtor should 
pay the assignor or a subsequent assignee, such pay- 
ment would not discharge the debtor, and the first 
assignee could collect the claim from him. 

NON-ASSIGNABLE RIGHTS.â€” Rights can- 
not be assigned which are personal in their nature. 
The one who has contracted to paint a picture can- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 107 

not delegate the duty to another, no matter how 
skillful. One who has a right to the personal services 
of an employee cannot assign that right to another. 
A publisher who has a right to publish all books writ- 
ten by a certain author cannot assign his right to 
another publisher. 

ASSIGNMENT OF DUTIES.â€” The duties un- 
der a contract are not assignable under any circum- 
stances. That is, one who owes money or is bound 
to any performance can not by any act of his own or 
by any act in agreement with any other person except 
his creditor, divest himself of liability and substitute 
the liability of another. This is sufficiently obvious 
when attention is called to it; for otherwise debtors 
would find an easy practical way of escaping from 
their debts by assigning the duty to pay to irrespon- 
sible persons. But the principle is not always re- 
cognized. A person who is subject to a duty, though 
he cannot escape liability, may delegate the perform- 
ance of his obligation provided the duty is of such 
a character that performance by an agent will be sub- 
stantially the same thing as performance by the obli- 
gor himself. Thus if a contractor engages to build a 
house, he may delegate the actual building to another, 
but he cannot escape responsibility for the work. One 
who owes a mortgage may delegate the payment of 
the mortgage to a purchaser of the land who assumes 
and agrees to pay the debt. If the purchaser of the 
land actually pays, the debt is discharged; but if he 
fails to do so, the mortgagee may sue the original 
mortgagor and the latter will be obliged to bring 



108 COMMERCIAL LAW 

another action against the purchaser who promised 
to pay the debt and failed to do so. So where a part- 
nership is changed and a new firm formed, it is very 
common for the new firm to assume the obligations of 
the old firm. 

ORIGINAL DEBTOR NOT DISCHARGED 
UNLESS THERE IS A NOVATION.â€” Though a 
creditor cannot be deprived of his right against his 
original debtor without his consent, he may consent. 
If he does thus consent to take in lieu of the obligation 
of his orginal debtor that of the person who assumed 
the debt, what is called a novation is created. That 
frequently happens where a new firm succeeds an 
old one. The new firm goes on dealing with the old 
creditors, and they impliedly, if not expressly, assent 
to taking the new firm instead of the old firm as a 
debtor. But in order to make out a novation you have 
got to fi_nd as a fact that the creditor agreed to give 
up his right against the old debtor. If the creditor 
does not assent to a novation then the situation is 
that the creditor retains his claim against the old 
debtor, but the person who has assumed the debt has 
contracted to pay that debt. If he keeps his contract 
he will pay it and the debt will be cancelled. If he 
does not keep his contract the creditor will sue the 
original debtor and the original debtor will sue the 
man who assumed the debt. 

ASSIGNMENT OF BILATERAL CON- 
TRACTS. â€” In bilateral contracts each party is un- 
der a duty to perform his promise, and also has a 
right to the performance of the other party. If an 



COMMERCIAL LAW 109 

attempt is made to assign such a contract the effect 
is this : the assignor delegates to the assignee the duty 
of performing the assignor's promise, but the assignor 
himself still remains liable if his agent, the assignee, 
fails to carry out the duty. Further, the assignor 
authorizes the assignee to receive the payment or per- 
formance due from the other party to the contract 
and to keep it for himself. 

WHAT AMOUNTS TO AN ASSIGNMENT.â€” 
No particular words are necessary to constitute an 
assignment. Any words which show an intention 
that another shall be the owner of a right are sufficient 
to constitute the latter an assignee. Especially it 
should be observed that an order directed to a debtor 
of the drawer ordering him to pay the debt to a named 
payee, is an assignment of the debt when delivered to 
the payee. This case must be sharply distinguished 
from a bill of exchange or check. A bill of exchange 
or check is an order to pay a certain amount uncondi- 
tionally, irrespective of the existence of any particu- 
lar fund. It is only an order to pay from a particular 
fund, that is, an order which is conditional expressly 
or impliedly on the existence of that fund, which con- 
stitutes an assignment. 

PARTIAL ASSIGNMENT.â€” A creditor may 
not only assign his whole claim to an assignee, but 
he may assign part of it. Such a partial assignment 
authorizes the assignee to collect the portion of the 
claim assigned and keep it for himself. But the debtor 
is not bound to pay the claim piecemeal ; he may insist 
on making but a single payment unless his contract 



110 COMMERCIAL LAW 

with his creditor provides otherwise. A bank in ac- 
cepting a deposit contracts to pay that deposit in 
such amounts as the depositor may indicate on the 
checks drawn by him, but an ordinary debtor who 
owes $100 cannot be required to pay in such amounts 
as his creditor may see fit to demand. For this reason 
a few courts hold that even if the debtor has notice 
of a partial assignment, he may pay the whole debt to 
the original creditor though that results in defraud- 
ing the partial assignee. Most courts hold, however, 
that the debtor when notified of the facts cannot do 
this, and if he objects to paying fractional parts of his 
indebtedness he must pay the whole sum into court 
to be distributed by it among the parties entitled. So, 
on a question of this character, the local statute 
should be examined. 

ASSIGNMENT OF FUTURE CLAIMS.â€” 
Assignments of future claims, as well as of existing 
claims, may be made, but there are in many States 
some special provisions of statute law in regard to 
assigning future wages. Such assignments must 
often be recorded, and there are certain other special 
statutory provisions in regard to them. The assign- 
ment of future debts is also subject to this qualifica- 
tion: The law does not allow the assignment of a 
future claim unless the contract or employment out 
of which the claim is expected to arise has already 
been made or is already in existence. 

DISCHARGE OF CONTRACTS.â€” Contracts 
are discharged in much the same way as they are 
made. The simplest way of discharging a contract is 



COMMERCIAL LAW HI 

by performing it. When both parties do exactly what 
they agreed to do the contract is discharged by per- 
formance. Where seals still retain their common law 
effect, it may be discharged without performance by 
agreement under seal that it shall be discharged, just 
as a contract may be made by an agreement under 
seal. The agreement under seal to discharge a con- 
tract is called a release. You may release any right 
that you have â€” a right for money, a right to have 
work done or any right. Just as contracts may be 
made either under seal or by an agreement with con- 
sideration, so they may be discharged not only by a 
release under seal but by an agreement for rescission 
of the contract. But this agreement must have con- 
sideration. 

ILLUSTRATIONS.â€” Suppose A has promised 
to build a house and B has promised to pay $10,000 
for it. Before anything has been done, A and B agree 
to call that contract off. This is a valid agreement for 
rescission, because each party agrees to give up some- 
thing â€” one party to give up his right to have the house 
built, the other party to give up the right to get 
$10,000 pay. So an agreement between employer and 
employee that a contract shall be terminated before 
the time originally agreed has sufficient considera- 
tion â€” the employer gives up his right to the em- 
ployee's services, the employee gives up his right for 
future pay. But compare with these this case : A owes 
B a thousand dollars; it is simply a debt. A and B 
agree to call that square. That agreement is of no 
validity, for here only one party agrees to give up 



112 COMMERCIAL LAW 

anything. The creditor agrees to give up his thousand 
dollars, and he does not get any promised amount in 
return for it. But that obligation, that debt, could be 
satisfied if valid consideration were given for the sur- 
render of the claim; and anything agreed upon, as a 
horse, or ten shares of stock, or anything else the 
parties agreed to, would be good consideration for 
the agreement to surrender the claim, so long as one 
did not get into the difficulty alluded to under the 
heading of consideration, of trying to surrender a 
right to a larger liquidated sum in consideration of the 
payment of a smaller sum of money. 

SENDING A CHECK AS FULL PAYMENT. 
â€” It is very common for a debtor in making payment 
by check of his debt to seek to make the check operate 
as a receipt in full of all claims by the creditor against 
him. He may do this by writing on the check itself 
that it is "in full of all demands" or "in full payment" 
of a certain bill ; or he may by a letter accompanying 
the check state that the check is sent as full satisfac- 
tion. The acceptance by the creditor of the check 
under either of these circumstances is an assent by 
him to the proposition stated on the check or in the 
accompanying letter, that the check is in full pay- 
ment. Such an assent, however, does not necessarily 
prove that the debtor is discharged; consideration as 
well as mutual assent is essential to the validity of 
any agreement which is not under seal. Accordingly 
if the debt was a liquidated and undisputed one, and 
the check was for less than the amount due, the agree- 
ment of the creditor to take it in full satisfaction is 



COMMERCIAL LAW 113 

not supported by sufficient consideration under prin- 
ciples previously considered. On the other hand, if 
the debt was an unliquidated one, or there was an 
honest dispute in regard to the amount due, the cred- 
itor's claim is fully satisfied. 

RECEIPT IN FULL.â€” It may be said gener- 
ally that though a receipt in full is often thought by 
business men to be a discharge irrespective of consid- 
eration, like a release; this is not true in most States. 
A receipt in full is good evidence, if payment has been 
made in full, that it has been so made ; but where pay- 
ment has not been made in full a receipt will not be 
effectual without consideration, as a release under seal 
would be. 

RENUNCIATION OF OBLIGATION ON 
NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT.â€” There is one 
case where the law allows a party who has a right to 
surrender it without consideration. This is by virtue 
of the Negotiable Instruments Law, which provides 
that the holder of a note may discharge any party to it 
by a written renunciation of his claim. No particular 
form of words is necessary, but the renunciation must 
be in writing. No consideration is necessary. 

ALTERATION OF WRITTEN CONTRACTS. 
â€” The alteration of a written contract in a material 
particular with fraudulent intent by a promisee in effect 
discharges the contract so far as he is concerned. He 
cannot enforce it either in its original form or its 
altered form, though the other party to the contract 
may enforce it against him. If the alteration is not 
material, the contract may be enforced even by the 



114 COMMERCIAL LAW 

party who altered it whatever the motive of the alter- 
ation may have been. If the alteration is material but 
not fraudulently intended, that party is generally al- 
lowed to enforce the contract in its original form. No 
alteration by a third person affects the rights of a 
party to a contract. By material alteration is meant 
one which if given effect would alter the legal obliga- 
tions of the parties to the contract. The rule of the 
Negotiable Instruments Law in regard to alteration 
of negotiable instruments, it should be observed, is 
somewhat more severe than that generally prevailing 
in regard to other contracts. 

SUGGESTIONS FOR DRAFTING CON- 
TRACTS. â€” While it is unwise to attempt the drafting 
of any contract at all complicated, without the ser- 
vices of an attorney, there are certain times when it 
may be necessary to act suddenly, and a few funda- 
mental facts should be kept in mind. If you are called 
upon to draft a contract for two other people, the first 
requisite is to obtain as full information as possible 
from both parties as to the plans they have in mind. 
After obtaining this, the details should be arranged 
in writing, gone over carefully by the draftsman, and 
submitted to the parties for their approval. A most 
common mistake made by laymen is to fail to cover 
contingencies which are more or less likely to happen. 
For example, what effect would the death of either 
party have on the contract? This should be provided 
for. The careful draftsman, whether he be a layman 
or a lawyer, should draw contracts with the idea of 
making them so plain that litigation will not result. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 115 

Contracts should alv^^ays be drawn in duplicate, so 
that each party may have a copy, and it is well, if 
you are the draftsman, to keep a copy for yourself. It 
is not necessary to appear before a notary public un- 
less you are dealing with a deed, or a similar formal 
document. If there is good consideration for the con- 
tract, no seal is necessary, but under some statutes, a 
sealed contract is good for a longer period of time, so 
that there is an added advantage in having the con- 
tract under seal. 

QUASI CONTRACTS.â€” The term quasi con- 
tract is one which has appeared within the last thirty 
years. The law in this branch of contracts is still in 
the process of development and the field of quasi con- 
tracts is still not one of settled limits. For our pur- 
poses we confine ourselves to those obligations arising 
from "unjust enrichment," that is, the receipt by one 
person from another of a benefit, the retention of 
which is unjust. The term "enrichment" has recently 
been criticized by one of the ablest writers on this 
topic, as there are many cases where it is sufficient to 
show that the defendant has received something which 
he desired,although the question whether he is thereby 
enriched, is immaterial. In Vickery v. Ritchie, 202 
Mass. 247, we find that where A renders services, and 
furnishes materials and supplies for the erection of a 
building for B under a supposed contract and the con- 
tract itself is invalid, B is under a supposed quasi con- 
tractual obligation to pay A for the services he has 
rendered and the material he has furnished, regardless 
of whether B's property is increased in value. We 



l^ 



// 



116 COMMERCIAL LAW 

may state the point to be emphasized in quasi contract 
is the fact that the retention of the benefit received by 
the defendant would be unjust rather than "enrich- 
ment." 

DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS.â€” 
There are four characteristics which distinguish quasi- 
contracts: 1. The obligations of quasi contracts are im- 
posed by law without reference to the assent of the 
obligor. 2. They are imposed because of a special 
state of facts and in favor of a particular person and do 
not rest upon one at all times and in favor of all per- 
sons. 3. Although equitable in their origin they are 
enforced by a common law court. 4. They require 
that the obligee shall be compensated for the benefit 
which he has conferred upon the obligor and not for 
any loss suffered by the obligee. 

APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE.â€” The 
following are the more common illustrations of the 
application of the principles of quasi contracts. 
Where there has been a mistake, and hence the minds 
of the parties never really met, yet benefit has really 
been conferred ; or, where the attempted contract can- 
not be enforced as a contract, because it did not com- 
ply with the statute, or was illegal, and yet one of the 
parties has received a benefit; or, where a benefit has 
been conferred under compulsion or duress. 

MISTAKE.â€” Where parties have attempted to 
make a contract and a mistake of fact occurs, no con- 
tract results. The minds of the parties never really 
meet. Yet if benefits have been conferred, justice re- 
quires that the benefit should be returned, or compen- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 117 

sation given, and this, in fact, is just what the law 
seeks to do when there has been such a mistake that 
upon the attempted contract itself no suit can be 
brought. The essentials of mistake, and the way in 
which a mistake usually arises, are: 

(1) It would not be a mistake if a party had paid 
money when he had any reason to suppose it was not 
due. A recovery of money under such circumstances 
cannot be allowed. 

(2) The payment must have been induced by mis- 
take in order to allow the recovery. This rule pre- 
vents the recovery of money paid in settlement of a 
disputed matter ; but it must be assumed that it was to 
the party's interest to make the payment. However, 
suppose that a compromise settlement has been made 
in the belief that certain facts were different from 
what they really were. Here the mistake would have 
induced the pa5mient, and, hence, in such a situation a 
recovery will be allowed. 

(3) The fact regarding which a mistake has been 
made must also be a material fact, and the fact must 
have been a part of the transaction itself, not collateral 
to it in any way. A mistake as to the value of an 
article purchased, for instance, is not a material fact. 

(4) Ordinarily, money paid under mistake of law 
cannot be recovered, although it is against conscience 
for the defendant to retain it. A mistake as to the law 
of another State, however, is a mistake of fact, and 
money paid under such a mistake can be recovered. 

(5) Where the party who mistakenly parted with 
the money did so because of his own negligence, and to 



118 COMMERCIAL LAW 

allow a recovery would throw a loss on the other 
party, he cannot recover what he parted with. One 
party cannot make another suffer because of his own 
negligence. Where a party paid money under mis- 
take, and the payee was negligent, the party paying 
may recover. 

(6) When parties suppose they have made a con- 
tract, and money has been paid, or services rendered, 
under that supposed contract, but in fact there was no 
valid contract at all, or there was a mutual mistake as 
to a term, this money, or the value of the services, may 
be recovered. 

(7) When money has been paid for the transfer 
of something by defendant, whether recovery will be 
allowed in case it should turn out that the defendant 
had no title, depends on the nature of transaction. If 
the defendant made a warranty that he had title, a 
recovery may be had. If, however, the defendant 
simply sold what he had, whether that was some- 
thing or nothing, a recovery cannot be allowed un- 
less, as is the law in some States, a vendor impliedly 
warrants his title by the fact of having possession. 

(8) In the case of parties mistaking the existence 
of a subject matter of sale, if the understanding was 
that A was purchasing an existing thing, then he can 
recover the money paid if it should turn out that the 
thing was not in existence. But if he bought simply a 
chance, he cannot recover. 

BENEFITS CONFERRED UNDER COLOR 
OF CONTRACT.â€” Aside from the cases of mistake, 
there are other grounds for allowing recovery under 



COMMERCIAL LAW 119 

the principle of quasi contract. A group of these is 
made up of cases where there cannot be a recovery 
upon the contract itself, although the parties have 
come together and agreed without any mistake or 
misunderstanding, because of the absence of some 
essential necessary to create an enforceable contract 
obligation; yet a benefit has been conferred upon the 
one party who, but for the lack of that essential, would 
have been liable in an action upon the contract itself. 
Such cases arise largely where there has been a partial 
performance of an illegal contract, or of a contract 
unenforceable because of non-compliance with the sta- 
tute of frauds, or v/here full performance is excused by 
impossibility. Some States also allow recovery on 
the theory of benefits conferred, where, after partial 
performance, a party defaults under circumstances not 
excusing default. 

BENEFITS CONFERRED WITHOUT CON- 
TRACT. â€” We next take up that class of relations 
where there has been an absence of distinct offer and 
acceptance, and yet a benefit has been conferred re- 
sulting in an unjust enrichment of the other party. 
If A confers benefit on B, though at B's request, it 
may be merely a gift. A cannot afterward change his 
mind and recover for that, as if there had been a con- 
tract. A may have paid B's debt in order to prevent 
a sale of his own property. He may then recover the 
amount so paid. For example, A left his property 
with B to have some repairs made. A third party 
recovered a judgment against B, and A's property 
was seized on an execution. A paid the judgment in 



120 COMMERCIAL LAW 

order to release his own property. It was held that he 
might recover the money so paid from B, who should 
have paid the judgment. Or A may have paid B's 
debt because he was surety for B. He then may re- 
cover from B the amount so paid; or, if B had two 
sureties, A and C, and A paid the whole or more than 
his share, he could recover the share of such payment 
which C should have paid, on the principle of contri- 
bution that equality is equity. But A must have ac- 
tually made the payment of more than his proportion- 
ate share. 



CHAPTER IV 



Principal and Agent; Master and 

Servant 

THE IMPORTANCE OF AGENCY.â€” Now 
that we have finished our discussion of the gen- 
eral principles of contract law, it remains for 
us to apply these principles to the specific topics of 
commercial law. Of these, the law of agency is one of 
the most important. It is perfectly obvious that a 
man can be in only one locality at a given time. Under 
modern business conditions he may wish to perform 
acts in different places at the same time. When busi- 
ness men were first confronted with problems of this 
kind, the principles of the law of agency began to de- 
velop. They resorted to the simple expedient of hav- 
ing others represent them. If these representatives 
were properly instructed in their duties and faithful 
in discharging them, there was, of course, no reason 
why the will of the person who had appointed them 
was not as fully accomplished as if he had performed 
the act himself. The Latin maxim, "Qui facit per 
alium facit per se," that is, "He who acts through an- 
other, acts himself," is the basis of the law of agency. 
The growing importance of the law of agency is strik- 
ingly apparent in one branch of modern business. 
Fifty years ago, the great majority of business opera- 
tions were conducted either by individuals or by part- 
nerships. To-day, especially in conducting large busi- 

121 



122 COMMERCIAL LAW 

ness enterprises, corporations have replaced individ- 
uals and partnerships. Although (as we shall see 
later in the chapter on corporations) in law a corpo- 
ration is deemed a separate, legal entity, distinct from 
the stockholders, in actual practice we know that 
there is no such distinct physical being as a corpora- 
tion. It follows, therefore, that every act performed 
by a corporation must be performed through an 
agent. With the enormous increase in the number of 
corporations in the last twenty-five years, and that 
increase still continuing, we can see that the law of 
agency is a most important branch of commercial law 
and very closely connected with corporation law. 

AGENCY DEFINED.â€” Merely for purposes of 
convenience, it may be best to divide the whole sub- 
ject of agency into three branches: Principal and 
agent; master and servant; employer and indepen- 
dent contractor. The term "agency," when used in 
the broad sense, indicates a relation which exists 
where one person is employed to act for another. At 
the outset, we should keep in mind the distinctions 
between the agent, the servant, and the independent 
contractor. It is difficult to indicate these distinctions 
with absolute certainty by definition. An illustra- 
tion, however, will show clearly what the difference 
is. I own an apartment house in New York, but as I 
am not in the city, except infrequently, I employ the 
real estate firm of Smith & Jones to manage the 
apartments and collect the rents. They are, of course, 
my agents, to act in the premises. I own an automo- 
bile and I employ a chauffeur to operate the car for 



COMMERCIAL LAW 123 

me. He is my servant. I own a vacant lot in New 
York and on it plan to erect an office building. I em- 
ploy the Smith Construction Company to erect the 
building. It is an independent contractor. What is 
the rule, then, to determine the distinction between 
these three persons? All three persons represent the 
principal, or the master, or the employer, but the line 
of distinction lies here : An agent is employed to bring 
the principal into new contractual obligations; a ser- 
vant represents his master in the performance of min- 
isterial, or mechanical acts or services, with no 
thought of bringing his master into new contractual 
relations with third persons. A person who is em- 
ployed to perform ministerial or mechanical acts for 
another, as we have said, is a servant, but there are 
cases where the master retains no control or right 
of control of the means or methods by which such 
work is to be accomplished. In this latter case, the 
person performing the v/ork is not a servant, but is an 
independent contractor. 

HOW AGENCY MAY ARISE.â€” Although 
agency undoubtedly originated from the relationship 
of master and servant, and that relationship from the 
enforced service rendered by slaves to their master, 
to-day the law of agency in the broad sense is a con- 
tractual relationship. The agent or servant or inde- 
pendent contractor becomies such upon the express 
or implied request of the principal. Although agency 
may exist, in so far as third persons are concerned, 
without any formal contract betw^een the principal 
and the agent, yet, in the great majority of cases, there 



124 COMMERCIAL LAW 

is an actual contract between the parties to the rela- 
tion. Compensation, although usually an element in 
the contract, is not necessarily a requisite. For in- 
stance, I may be liable for the negligent act of my son 
in running my automobile in connection with my busi- 
ness, although he is acting without any compensation. 
There are four methods by which the relationship of 
agency arises: (1) By contract; (2) by ratification; 
(3) by estoppel; (4) by necessity. 

WHO IS OR MAY BE AN AGENT.â€” The law 
of agency, as between principal and agent, is simply 
an application of the general law of contracts, but as 
between third parties and the principal, or agent, new 
questions arise. The first question is, who is an agent 
and who is a principal? Any employer is a principal 
and any employee is an agent. The employer is a prin- 
cipal whether he employs the employee for a single 
act or whether he employs him for a period of time. 
Besides the ordinary cases that you will think of under 
the head of employer and employee, an officer of a 
corporation is an agent, the corporation being the 
principal. The president of a corporation is as much 
an agent as a clerk in the employ of the corporation. 
A partner is an agent â€” of the firm. These different 
kinds of agents are distinguished chiefly in the differ- 
ent scope of the authority which they possess. 

DISABILITY. â€” In our discussion of contracts, 
we found that certain persons were under disability 
so far as making contracts was concerned. We men- 
tioned the case of infants, married women, insane per- 
sons, and the like. The same disabilities do not exist 



COMMERCIAL LAW 125 

in the law of agency, so far as the agent is concerned. 
Any person may act as an agent or servant. So in- 
fants, married women, slaves, and even lunatics, may 
be agents or servants whose acts will bind their prin- 
cipals. It has been held that even a dog may be an 
agent. As to who may be a principal, the ordinary 
rules of contracts, as we have discussed them, may be 
relied upon as giving the correct rule. 

AGENCY BY CONTRACT.â€” Concerning 
agency which arises by contract, little need be said. 
A contract of agency must possess all of the elements 
of the ordinary contract, such as mutual assent, con- 
sideration, competent parties, legality of object, and 
in some cases, a particular form. The general prin- 
ciples of contract law as we have discussed them are 
applicable to this method of forming the agency rela- 
tionship. 

POWERS OF ATTORNEY.â€” In connection 
with the formation of agency by contract, special at- 
tention must be given to powers of attorney. A power 
of attorney must oftentimes be given in order to con- 
vince third persons that the agent really is an agent, 
with the powers which he claims to possess. A power 
of attorney is nothing more than a written statement 
that a particular person is the agent of another per- 
son, with the powers stated in the document. A power 
of attorney may be very broad, giving the agent very 
wide powers, or may be narrow, giving the agent or 
attorney power to do only a specific thing. Now, 
many powers, so far as the law itself is concerned, 
might just as well be oral as written, but you could 



126 COMMERCIAL LAW 

not induce third parties to deal with the agent and 
believe that he had authority unless he showed as 
proof of it a power of attorney. That is why a power 
of attorney is generally given; not that the law re- 
quires it, but that the agent may have evidence of his 
agency which will satisfy third persons that he is 
really the agent. A corporation would not transfer 
stock without a written power presented to it ; yet, if 
it chooses to run the risk, there would be nothing ille- 
gal in doing so. But it does not choose, and an at- 
tempt to compel it to transfer would be held unrea- 
sonable unless the authority of the person claiming 
to be empowered to transfer the stock were in writing 
and shown to it. 

WITNESSED AND SEALED POWERS OF 
ATTORNEY. â€” A witness is not necessary on a 
power of attorney. A witness on a power of attorney 
has the same effect as on any other document where 
a witness is not absolutely required, and that is this: 
if the signature of a document is called in question 
and the signature is witnessed, the way which the 
law requires proof of the signature is by calling the 
witness to testify, and no other evidence is permis- 
sible until the witness is produced or his absence ac- 
counted for; that is, some adequate reason given and 
proved for not producing the particular man who 
witnessed the signature. For this very reason it is 
sometimes more difficult to prove a signature which 
is witnessed than one v/hich is not. A signature which 
is not witnessed may be proved by anybody who has 
seen the person sign, or who is familiar with his sig- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 127 

nature, and who can testify that the signature in ques- 
tion is his. The object of a witness is to provide cer- 
tain evidence that a signature is genuine. The testi- 
mony of a witness may be more convincing in case of 
a dispute than testimony of one who merely recog- 
nizes the signer's handwriting. A witnessed power 
of attorney might be, however, more difficult to prove 
if the power of attorney were contested than if it was 
not witnessed, that is, if the witness could not be 
found. On the other hand, if you had your witness 
within reach it would be easy to prove the signature 
by him. The whole matter of witnesses to deeds and 
other documents, where a witness is not absolutely 
required, may be thus summarized : it is a good thing 
to have a witness if the witness is a reliable, well- 
known person who can always or generally be 
reached. It is a bad thing to have a witness who is a 
servant or a person whom you may lose sight of after 
some time has elapsed. The question may also be 
asked: How does a power of attorney, when given 
under seal, compare with one without a seal? One is 
as good as the other, except that if it is desired that 
the attorney or agent shall execute any instrument 
under seal, such as a deed of real estate, the power 
must itself be under seal ; but a power to do anything 
which does not require the execution of a sealed in- 
strument is just as good without a seal as with one. 
This, however, is true ; if the power contains an agree- 
ment by the principal not to revoke the power, this 
agreement will not be binding if there is neither seal 
nor consideration, but will be binding without consid- 



128 COMMERCIAL LAW 

eration if under seal, in a State where seals still have 
their common-law effect. The principal will be able, 
it is true, even in such a case, to revoke the power, 
but he will commit a breach of contract if he does. 

AGENCY BY RATIFICATION.â€” Where the 
assent of the principal to the act of the agent is given 
after the act is performed, it is in the nature of a rati- 
fication of the act, and is intended to clothe the act 
with the same qualities as if there had been a previous 
authority or appointment. Suppose, for example, A 
and B are acquaintances. Both are wealthy. A is a 
good judge of horses and knows B likes good horses. 
A discovers what he considers a good horse and buys 
it for B at a very low price. He tells B the next day 
what he has done and B goes to get the horse and 
tenders the price, but the dealer refuses to sell, as he 
has been offered a higher price. B has a cause of 
action for breach of contract, for by ratifying A's act, 
he has made a binding contract between himself and 
the dealer. Suppose in the same illustration, A had 
selected two horses for B, but when B saw them he 
decided to take only one of them. In that case, there 
would be no contract, for it is fundamental that a 
ratification, to be effective, must be of the whole con- 
tract, and rot of a part. A ratification, once it is given, 
dates back to the original transaction and is irrevoc- 
able. 

FORMATION OF AGENCY BY ESTOPPEL. 
â€” An estoppel may be said to arise where a person 
does some act which will preclude him from averring 
anything to the contrary. So, if one holds out another 



COMMERCIAL LAW 129 

as his agent, he is estopped to repudiate the acts of such 
a person within the scope of his ostensible authority. 
In the case of Bradish v. Belknap, 41 Vt. 172, the facts 
were that for a long time prior to 1863, B was the 
agent of the defendants in selling stoves. This fact 
was generally known and was well known to the plain- 
tiff. In 1863 B ceased to be the agent of the defendant, 
but continued to sell stoves, which he purchased of 
the defendants. No public notice of the termination 
of the agency was given, nor was the fact known to 
the plaintiff. B continued to represent himself as 
agent of the defendants and was in the habit of taking 
notes for stoves sold, payable to the defendants, and 
this was known to the defendants. The plaintiff, be- 
lieving B to be the agent of the defendant, offered to 
buy a stove of him and pay him in pine lumber. To 
this B assented and the lumber was accordingly fur- 
nished to B and the defendants, together with other 
lumber which the plaintiff charged up to the defen- 
dants. The defendants later attempted to escape lia- 
bility for the lumber furnished in excess of the value 
of the stove. The court, holding them liable, said: 
"B during all this time was perfectly poor and irre- 
sponsible, and this fact was known by both parties. 
B represented himself as the agent of the defendants, 
and the conduct of the defendants was such as to jus- 
tify the plaintiff in regarding them as the principals; 
and we can hardly conceive it possible under the cir- 
cumstances that the defendants did not understand 
that the plaintiff so regarded them. And to allow 
them now to deny the agency and thus defeat the 



130 COMMERCIAL LAW 

plaintiff's right to recover for the balance of the lum- 
ber would be permitting them to perpetrate a palpable 
fraud on the plaintiff." 

ESTOPPEL DEFINED.â€” This term will occur 
several times in the different topics of commercial law. 
An estoppel may be said to arise when a party by con- 
duct or language has caused another reasonably to 
believe in the existence of a certain state of things and 
the other party acts on that belief, the first party is 
precluded from denying the existence of that state of 
things to any one who has justifiably relied on his 
language or conduct. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” There is a common saying 
in admiralty, that a seaman's claim for wages is nailed 
to the last plank of the vessel. So if boatswain John 
Silver is left unpaid by his vessel in London and he 
later finds the vessel in New York, although its own- 
ership has entirely changed meanwhile, he may still 
file a libel for his wages and have the United States 
Marshal for the Southern District of New York seize 
the vessel. Suppose however you contemplate buying 
a vessel. You go on board with the present owner 
and while all the members of the crew are lined up on 
the main deck, you ask him in a voice loud enough to 
be heard by everybody whether there are any unpaid 
wage claims. He replies that everything is paid to 
date. The crew remain silent. You purchase the 
vessel and a few weeks later members of this same 
crew seek to collect from the vessel a wage claim of 
one year's standing. Their claims against the vessel 
or agciinst you as owner are unenforcable. In other 



COMMERCIAL LAW 131 

words, they are estopped because of their conduct 
when you purchased the vessel. If a person does not 
speak when he ought, at times the law will not allow 
him to speak when he wishes. Boatswain Silver had 
never done anything to preclude him from asserting 
his wage claim. His, therefore, is not a case of es- 
toppel. 

AGENCY BY NECESSITY.â€” The authority of 
the agent may be enlarged by some particular neces- 
sity or sudden emergency in which case it is the duty 
of the agent to act, even though he cannot receive 
the advice or directions of his principal. This method 
of creating the agency relationship is one upon which 
the courts are not agreed, and there is great conflict 
in the decisions. The case of Gwilliam v. Twist, 
(1895) 1 Q. B. 557, and 2 Q. B. 84, is a good illustra- 
tion of how close the line may be drawn. The facts 
were that the driver of an omnibus belonging to de- 
fendants became intoxicated while on duty and was 
taken from his seat by a policeman. A man who hap- 
pened to be standing near volunteered to drive the 
omnibus to the defendant's yard, and the driver and 
conductor acquiesced, the former warning him to 
drive carefully. The volunteer in negligently turning 
a corner ran over and injured the plaintiff, who 
brought action for damages against the defendants, 
owners of the omnibus. The trial court held, with 
considerable hesitation, that the defendants were 
liable for the injury, placing its decision upon the 
ground of agency by necessity ; but the court of appeal 
reversed the decision on the ground that the neces- 



132 COMMERCIAL LAW 

sity did not sufficiently appear, since the defendants 
might have been communicated with, and left open 
the question whether, if there had been an actual ne- 
cessity, the defendants would have been liable. 

RIGHT OF PRINCIPAL TO DILIGENT 
AND SKILLFUL SERVICE.â€” Let us consider, first, 
the rights of the principal and agent as between one 
another. The rights which the principal has against 
the agent are, first, a right to have the employee ren- 
der reasonably diligent and skillful service. The 
amount of skill which the employer can fairly demand 
from his agent depends on the character of the con- 
tract between the two and on the circumstances justi- 
fying the principal in expecting a greater or less 
degree of skill. When a man employs an expert 
accountant to act for him he has a right to expect 
greater skill than if he were employing an ordinary 
bookkeeper. It depends on the character of the work 
and of the man employed. The amount of compen- 
sation paid to the employee may also have a bearing 
on the amount of skill the employer has a right to 
expect. 

RIGHT OF PRINCIPAL THAT AGENT 
SHALL NOT EXCEED HIS AUTHORITY.â€” The 
second right that a principal has is to demand from 
his agent that the agent shall act in obedience to 
instructions and only within the limits of his author- 
ity. These limits may be fixed expressly in the con- 
tract between principal and agent, or they may be 
left wholly to implication from the nature of the em- 
ployment. Perhaps more commonly they are partly 



COMMERCIAL LAW 133 

fixed by express agreement and partly fixed by nat- 
ural implications which arise from the nature of the 
employment. 

RIGHT OF PRINCIPAL TO ACCOUNTING. 
â€” Thirdly, the principal has a right in financial deal- 
ings with his agent, or in regard to financial dealings 
of the agent with third persons, to demand an account 
from his agent. It is not enough that the agent actu- 
ally expend money intrusted to him correctly; he 
must furnish a correct account of expenses and of 
collections. 

RIGHT OF PRINCIPAL TO FIDELITY.â€” 
Finally, the agent is under a duty of fidelity or loy- 
alty to his principal. The principal is entitled to de- 
mand that the agent, unless the contrary is agreed, 
shall make the employment or agency his sole interest 
in regard to that particular thing. Of course, in many 
agencies the agent is undertaking a great deal of 
outside business besides the particular agency in 
question, and he has a right so to do so long as the 
principal has not engaged his whole time, and so long 
as one agency does not interfere with another. But 
that last is an important point. An agent who under- 
takes one task for one principal which occupies only 
one-tenth of his time cannot take another employ- 
ment which is inconsistent with that. An agent to 
sell a particular kind of goods for one principal, even 
though his agency is not expected to take the agent's 
whole time, cannot undertake an agency for a com- 
peting principal. The two things are inconsistent, 
and the agent would be disloyal if he accepted. 



134 COMMERCIAL LAW 

SIDE COMPENSATION.â€” Then, again, the 
agent must not get what may be called "side com- 
pensation" of any sort. His whole compensation as 
agent must be what is due him directly from the prin- 
cipal under the agreement. For instance, if a buyer 
for a department store gets paid a commission by a 
firm from v/hich he buys goods, that is a side com- 
mission which the buyer as an agent has no right to 
take; and so strict is the law, that if an agent does 
take any such extra compensation the principal has 
a right to recover it from him. Of course, if the prin- 
cipal agrees to side compensation, it is all right for 
the agent to take it; when the principal agrees to it, 
it ceases to be what we have called side compensation 
and becomes part of the agent's direct compensation 
to which he is entitled under his bargain with his 
principal. 

ACTING AS AGENT FOR BOTH PARTIES. 
â€” One of the most common difficulties that agents get 
into in regard to this requirement of fidelity, and 
sometimes with entirely good faith, is undertak- 
ing to act as agent for both parties. That cannot be 
done unless each party especially agrees that the 
agent may act for the adverse party. An attorney-at- 
law cannot represent two sides of a case. A real estate 
broker cannot represent buyer and seller, and a stock 
broker cannot represent buyer and seller. Stock bro- 
kers have one practice which perhaps may seem to 
infringe this rule. A customer comes into a broker's 
office and says he wants to buy 100 shares of New 
York Central. About the same time another cus- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 135 

tomer comes in and says he wants to sell 100 shares 
of New York Central. Now, must a broker go on the 
exchange and make a purchase for one customer and 
then a sale for the other, or may he, so to speak, nego- 
tiate through himself a sale for the customer who 
wants to buy from the one who wants to sell? What 
he frequently does, in fact, is this : He buys and sells 
from himself, but publicly, giving other brokers the 
chance to buy or sell if they wish. The broker, ac- 
cording to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, 
cannot execute this transaction secretly in his office, 
but must offer the securities in question on the ex- 
change, and the purchase and sale must be recorded 
on the ticker. If the bidding and asking prices are 
more than an eighth apart, he may offer the New 
York Central at a price midway between the bidding 
and asking quotations and buy it himself and charge 
each customer a commission, but he must actually 
make the offer or bid aloud on the floor. The broker 
is technically acting for both parties, but he is not 
fixing the price. He makes an open bid on the ex- 
change, and it may be that would save the transac- 
tion. 

AGENT'S RIGHT TO COMPENSATION.â€” 
What are the rights of the agent against the princi- 
pal? They are two. First, a right to compensation; 
that is, a right to the pay that has been agreed upon, 
or, if no pay was agreed upon but it was understood 
that there should be some compensation, then a right 
to reasonable compensation. It is perfectly possible 
to have an agency without compensation. Frequently 



136 COMMERCIAL LAW 

one man agrees to act for another without pay, and 
an agent who is acting without compensation, so long 
as he acts as agent, is bound to the same obligations 
to his principal as if he were receiving compensation, 
only he can withdraw from his agency whenever he 
sees fit since he is not paid for it. But unless circum- 
stances show that an agency was understood to be 
without compensation, it would be implied that rea- 
sonable compensation was to be paid to the agent for 
his services. 

AGENT'S RIGHT TO REIMBURSEMENT.â€” 
The other right of the agent is the right to reimburse- 
ment and indemnity. As the agent is acting for the 
principal, the principal ought to pay all the bills of 
whatever kind incurred, so long as the agent is acting 
rightfully within his authority, and the principal is 
bound to pay all such bills. This obligation of the 
principal to pay all the bills of the agency means not 
simply that he must pay actual expenses, but that if 
liabilities of any kind arise by reason of third persons 
suing the agent or holding him liable, if the action of 
the agent was within his authority, the principal must 
indemnify against any loss. 

PRINCIPAL BOUND TO THIRD PERSONS 
BY AUTHORIZED ACTS OF AGENT.â€” Now let 
us turn from the rights of principal and agent as be- 
tween one another to the rights of third persons. 
When do third persons get rights against the prin- 
cipal? In the first place, whenever the agent, acting 
in accordance with his authority, enters into a trans- 
action with a third person on behalf of the principal. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 137 

the principal is bound to the third person to just the 
same extent as if he himself had entered into the 
transaction ; but it is not only in cases where express 
authority is given to the agent that this principle ap- 
plies. 

IMPLIED AUTHORITY OF AGENT.â€” In 
many cases the authority given an agent is not ex- 
pressly stated. One has to rely on the general course 
of business and on the nature of the employment to 
determine the extent of the agent's authority. A third 
person deals with a cashier of a bank, or deals with 
the paying teller, or he deals with the president ; now 
whether the bank is bound by that dealing depends 
on what is by general custom, or course of business, 
the authority of a cashier or a paying teller or a presi- 
dent. If cashiers or paying tellers or presidents gen- 
erally have certain authority, then it is a fair assump- 
tion that this particular officer has such authority. 

AUTHORITY TO DO PARTICULAR ACTS. 
â€” An agent to sell has generally no authority to make 
a sale on credit or to receive anything but money ; he 
cannot barter or exchange the property even in part, 
nor pledge or dispose of the property to be sold in 
payment of his own debts. For the sale of land an 
agent's authority ought always to be under seal, and 
the provisions contained in this power of attorney 
will be strictly construed. In a sale of personal prop- 
erty, an agent has implied authority to do whatever 
is usual and necessary in such transactions. He may 
receive payment if he has possession of the goods, but 
not otherwise, and warrant the quality, if such goods 



138 COMMERCIAL LAW 

are customarily sold with a warranty by agents. He 
cannot sell on credit unless such is the custom, as in 
the case of commission merchants, nor pledge or 
mortgage the goods. The agent may not buy on credit 
unless so authorized, or it is the custom of the trade ; 
but a principal's direction to purchase, without sup- 
plying the agent with funds, will imply authority to 
purchase on credit. The agent must purchase pre- 
cisely as directed. An agent to manage has an author- 
ity co-extensive in scope with the business, and 
possesses the same power and authority as the prin- 
cipal, so far as management goes, but the agent may 
not sell or dispose of a business, nor mortgage the pro- 
perty used in carrying it on, nor engage in new and 
different enterprises. Public agents, i. e., public 
officers, cannot involve their principals, the municipal 
corporations whose officers they are, in contract lia- 
bilities with third parties unless actually authorized 
to do the act in question ; and all persons dealing with 
them must inform themselves of the scope of their 
legal powers. 

APPARENT AUTHORITY OF AGENT.â€” 
But it is not only in cases where the agent is expressly 
authorized, or authorized by such implication as we 
have just alluded to, that the principal is bound. 
There is the further case where the agent has ap- 
parent authority, although, as a matter of fact, he has 
no authority. Take the case of a cashier certifying a 
check. We will suppose that cashiers, generally, have 
authority to certify checks. With most cashiers that 
would be what we have called an implied authority, 



COMMERCIAL LAW 139 

as it arises from the general nature of their positions 
though nothing was ever said about it by the bank 
directors. But suppose in a particular bank it was a 
rule of the bank, expressly stated and voted by the 
directors, that the cashier should not have power 
to certify checks. Now, no one can say that his power 
here is either express or implied; it is certainly not 
express, and any implication that might otherwise 
arise from his position is negatived by the express 
vote of the directors, and yet if that cashier should 
certify a check to any person ignorant of this limita- 
tion on his authority the bank would be bound by the 
certification because the cashier has apparent au- 
thority. He looks to the world as if he had authority, 
and seems to the public like any other cashier. Most 
of the difficult cases in agency, so far as liability of 
the principal to third persons is concerned, relate to 
this matter of apparent authority. 

ILLUSTRATIONS.â€” Compare the following 
case with the case of the cashier above alluded to : A 
man who is giving some support financially to a book 
dealer writes a note in which he says, "I authorize A 
B to buy a stock of books not exceeding, at any one 
time, $5,000." The book dealer shows that written 
authority to persons from whom he wishes to buy 
books. They sell him books, and, unknown to the last 
person who thus sells him books, he has just before 
bought a quantity which makes the total largely ex- 
ceed $5,000. Is the principal liable to the persons who 
last sold books to the dealer? The answer is no. And 
what is the difference between that case and the 



140 COMMERCIAL LAW 

cashier case? In the book case the last seller saw the 
paper giving authority to the book dealer to purchase. 
He had no reason to know that the day before a large 
quantity of books had been purchased. He acted in 
entire good faith and the deception was natural. Still, 
the employer, or the writer of the letter, has done 
nothing here to make the last seller suppose that 
$5,000 worth of books had not already been bought, 
nor does the course of business justify the last seller in 
supposing they might not already have been bought. 
It was a hard question for him to find out, but on 
the face of the letter it was evident that any one who 
dealt with the bookseller might have to determine this 
question or rely at his peril on the bookseller's word. 
Here is another case : a town treasurer was authorized 
to borrow a certain sum of money. He gets a certi- 
fied copy of the vote and goes to one bank and bor- 
rows the money, and goes to another bank with 
that same certified copy of the vote and borrows the 
money over again. Is the town liable to the second 
bank? No; on the face of the paper there was but 
one loan to the town authorized, and any one who 
lends the money must at his peril find out whether a 
loan has already been made. When we say, therefore, 
that a principal is bound if his agent had apparent 
authority, we do not mean that whenever a third per- 
son is deceived into the belief that the agent has 
authority, the principal is bound. Quite to the con- 
trary, the principal must have in some way been the 
cause of that deception ; he must have caused it either 
by some express representations, or he must have 



COMMERCIAL LAW 141 

caused it by putting a man in a place where the gen- 
eral course of business would induce the public to 
believe the agent had greater powers than he had. 

GENERAL AND SPECIAL AGENTS.â€” It is 
much easier to find a case of apparent authority, which 
will bind the principal, if the agent is a general agent 
than if he is a special agent. A special agent is an 
agent authorized to do one act, as this town treasurer 
was authorized to make one loan. The cashier is a 
general agent, authorized to do any of the great 
variety of acts which cashiers ordinarily do, and if the 
directors vote to take away one of the normal powers 
of the cashier, they must make the limitation public or 
the bank will be bound by the cashier's act. 

UNDISCLOSED PRINCIPAL.â€” Not only may 
the third person hold the principal liable in cases 
where the agent purports to act for the principal, 
but also in cases where the agent does not disclose his 
principal at all and purports to act as a principal him- 
self, so long as it is true that the agent really was 
acting in the principal's business. Suppose a selling 
agent for a manufactory enters into a contract for the 
sale of goods produced in the manufactory. The sell- 
ing agent, we will further suppose, contracts â€” as sell- 
ing agents often do â€” in his own name; but he con- 
tracts in regard to the sale of the product of the prin- 
cipal, the manufacturer, and on his behalf. Now, 
assume that this contract of the sales agent was au- 
thorized ; the third person may sue the manufacturing 
company, though he did not know of the existence of 
the manufactory at the time he entered into the con- 



142 COMMERCIAL LAW 

tract, and supposed he was contracting simply with 
the agent. As it is phrased in law, an undisclosed 
principal is liable, and conversely, the undisclosed 
principal may sue on this contract made by the sales 
agent. 

RATIFICATION.â€” If an agent acts beyond his 
authority, the principal, if he chooses, may ratify the 
acts of the agent. Occasionally in an emergency it 
becomes necessary for an agent who has his principal's 
interest at heart to take a chance and act beyond the 
authority given him. In such a case, if the principal 
ratifies it, it is all right, both as far as the agent is 
concerned, and as far as the third person is concerned ; 
but, of course, the principal is under no legal obliga- 
tion to ratify. 

RIGHTS OF PRINCIPAL AGAINST THIRD 
PERSONS. â€” Now, the right of the principal against 
the third person is the converse of the right of the 
third person against the principal, of which we have 
beenspeaking. Generally when a transaction is of such 
a sort that the third person would have a right of ac- 
tion against the principal, if the principal fails to do as 
he agreed, the principal will have a right of action 
against the third person if the latter breaks his agree- 
ment. 

PRINCIPAL IS LIABLE FOR TORTS OF 
AGENT. â€” Not only is the principal liable for the con- 
tracts of his agent, but he is also liable for any tort 
which an agent may commit, so long as he is acting in 
the course of his business. Of course, accident cases 
present the commonest type of that sort of liability. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 143 

A street railway is liable for the results of its motor- 
man's neglect, so long as the motorman was running 
the car. If the motorman got off the car on a frolic of 
his own, the street railway would not be liable for any- 
thing he might do then. The same principle may be 
found in other cases than accident cases. Suppose 
officers of a corporation wrongfully overissue stock. 
If those officers were the officers authorized to issue 
stock, and, therefore, were acting in the general 
course of their business, the corporation would be 
liable for that tortious act in overissuing stock. 

AUTHORITY MAY GENERALLY BE ORAL 
AS WELL AS WRITTEN.-â€” The authority given 
by a principal to an agent may in general be oral as 
well as written; it is just as good. There are, how- 
ever, a few exceptions to that. In the first place, an 
authority given to an agent to execute an instrument 
under seal must itself be not only written but under 
seal. An oral or a written authority, if not under 
seal, given to an agent to convey land, which must 
be conveyed by a sealed deed, would not enable 
the agent to make a valid deed. Where the effect 
of seals is abolished this principle is of course no 
longer applicable. Generally an agent orally au- 
thorized to make a contract to buy or sell land may 
bind his principal by entering into such a contract. 
The contract the agent enters into, must, because of 
the Statute of Frauds, be in writing, and signed, but 
the agent's authority generally need not be written. 
In some States, however, written authority is required 
by statutes. 



144 COMMERCIAL LAW 

PROXIES. â€” A proxy is simply a written power 
of attorney to an agent, authorizing him to vote for a 
stockholder, and there, too, a corporation would be 
held justified in refusing to recognize any proxy that 
was not in writing, or any agent who did not have a 
written proxy even though proxies were not required 
to be in writing. 

LIABILITY OF AGENT TO THIRD PER- 
SONS. â€” How about the rights and duties of the 
agent as against the outside world? The agent is 
liable to a third person if he commits a tort. It does 
not make any difference that the principal is also 
liable, the agent is liable too. The third person may 
sue either the principal or agent as he prefers; he 
cannot get compensation for his injury more than 
once, but he can get that either from the principal 
or agent, whichever is more convenient. The third 
person may hold the agent liable if the agent con- 
tracts for an undisclosed principal. In the case of the 
sales agent referred to a moment ago, where the agent 
was really acting as agent for a manufacturer but did 
not say so, the third person might sue the manufac- 
turer on the contract ; but he might sue the agent, and 
if the agent was held liable the agent would have to 
seek reimbursement from the principal. 

AGENT WARRANTS HIS AUTHORITY.â€” 
An agent is liable in one other case to the third per- 
son with whom he deals. If the agent did not have 
authority to do what he purported to do, the third per- 
son can sue him, though the third person could not 
sue the principal in this case, since the agent was 



COMMERCIAL LAW 145 

exceeding his authority. An agent is said to warrant 
his authority to third persons with whom he does 
business. 

AGENT CANNOT DELEGATE AUTHOR- 
ITY. â€” An important rule in agency is that an agent 
cannot delegate his authority. If A is appointed to 
do certain work, A must do it himself, and cannot 
empower B to do it if it proves inconvenient to do 
it himself. There are three exceptions to this rule. 
The first is that if he is given express permission to 
delegate his authority, he may do so, and, of course, 
if the principal should ratify an unpermitted delega- 
tion of authority, the ratification would here, as al- 
ways, serve as well as original authority. The second 
case is where the usage of business is such that the 
principal must be presumed to have understood that 
there was to be a delegation, or partial delegation, 
of authority, and in such a case, though the principal 
has not expressly authorized delegation, he will be 
treated as if he had authorized it by virtue of business 
usage. The third case where delegation is author- 
ized is in regard to what are called ministerial or 
mechanical acts, that is, acts which involve no exer- 
cise of judgment or skill. The principal is entitled to 
the agent's judgment and skill, but if there are parts 
of the work that do not require skill and that, from 
their nature, any ordinary clerical assistant can do, 
then such acts may be delegated. 

TERMINATION OF AGENCY BY ACT OF 
PARTIES. â€” The parties may have agreed in their 
contract that it should terminate at a certain time or 



146 COMMERCIAL LAW 

on the happening of a certain event. The arrival of 
that time or the happening of the event would of 
course end the relation as between them. It would 
not so operate as between principal and third parties, 
however, unless the third parties were informed. So, 
performance of the purpose for which the relation 
was created terminates the relation as between prin- 
cipal and agent. The parties may make a subsequent 
agreement to terminate the relation, and such an 
agreement would be good, the abandonment of the 
rights of each party created by the original contract 
being a sufficient consideration for the promise of 
each to surrender his own rights. 

REVOCATION.â€” Except in the case of irrevoc- 
able agency noted below, the principal may revoke at 
any time the agent's authority as to matters not al- 
ready executed. Any other rule would enslave the 
principal to his agent by forcing him, at the agent's 
will, and against his own consent, into contracts with 
third parties. But, while the principal has this right, 
the exercise of it may subject him to liability to his 
agent. If the contract of employment is for a definite 
time, and the principal, without cause, revokes the 
agent's authority before that time arrives, the prin- 
cipal is liable to the agent for breach of contract; if 
no time is fixed for the termination of the agency, it is 
an agency at will, and the principal, with or without 
cause, may revoke at any time without incurring 
liability to his agent. The acts which will amount to 
a revocation by the principal are various. For in- 
stance, if an agent has exclusive authority to repre- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 147 

sent the principal, the appointment of another agent 
would amount to a revocation. As to making the 
revocation effective, a revocation operates on the 
agent from the time he has notice of it. It is effective 
as to third parties only when notice is given to those 
who have dealt with the agent that the agent's au- 
thority is revoked. Without such notice the prin- 
cipal does not escape liability to third persons by 
reason of further acts on his agent's part. Where an 
agent is appointed in a particular business, parties 
dealing with him in that business have a right to rely 
upon the continuance of his authority until in some 
way informed of its revocation. This notice must be 
actual to those who have dealt with the agent, and 
general, as by publication in newspapers, where per- 
sons have not before dealt with the agent. 

RENUNCIATION.â€” The agent may renounce 
his employment at any time, but if he contracted to 
serve for a certain time, and renounce before that time 
arrives, he is liable to the principal for breach of con- 
tract, unless he has ground for renunciation, such as 
the principal's breach of faith with him. The sick- 
ness of the agent is a ground for renouncing the re- 
lation, even though the sickness be caused by his own 
negligence or wrong. The principal should inform 
third persons of the agent's renunciation if he would 
fully protect himself against further acts of the agent. 

TERMINATION OF AGENCY BY OPERA- 
TION OF LAW. â€” As in the case of ordinary con- 
tracts, a contract of agency may be terminated by the 
rules of law upon the happening of certain events. 



148 COMMERCIAL LAW 

Thus, the destruction of the subject-matter of the 
agency terminates the relation, if the parties contem- 
plated the continued existence of the subject-matter as 
the foundation for what was to be done. A change in 
the law, as the enactment of a statute declaring illegal 
agencies of a certain nature, that previously had been 
legal, terminates the relation. So also certain changes 
affecting the parties to the relation â€” i. e., the prin- 
cipal or the agent â€” effect a termination. The death 
of the principal brings the relation to an end, and this 
is so although the agent had no notice of it and sub- 
sequently dealt on behalf of his principal with third 
persons; such contracts do not bind the principal's 
estate. The death of the agent necessarily ends the 
relation. The occurrence of the principal's insanity 
terminates the relation, and a judicial finding of in- 
sanity is notice to all; but without notice of the in- 
sanity third persons who deal with the agent in good 
faith are protected. The bankruptcy of the principal 
terminates the relation as to all matters affected by 
the bankruptcy. Impossibility to continue the rela- 
tion brought about by restraint of law terminates the 
relation. 

IRREVOCABLE AGENCIES.â€” An agency to 
do an act touching a thing in which the agent has an 
interest, or in which he is subject to an obligation, 
cannot be terminated by act of the principal alone. 
The principal cannot terminate the relation so as to 
leave the agent under obligations to third persons, 
thereby shifting his obligations upon the agent; nor 
can he do so when the agent has an interest in the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 149 

subject-matter of the agency. It is difficult to state 
concisely what will constitute such an interest that 
the principal cannot terminate the relation, but it 
may be said to be some ownership or right in the 
matter dealt with, such that the agent may deal with 
it in his own name, and not a mere benefit to be 
obtained from the performance of the contract of 
agency, as a commission to be realized from sales. 
Possession of personal property with the right to 
sell, with authority to apply the proceeds to a debt 
due from the principal to the agent, is sometimes held 
to constitute an agency coupled with an interest such 
that the principal may not revoke it; on the other 
hand, an interest arising from commissions or the 
proceeds of a transaction, is not an interest which 
will prevent revocation. The courts carefully exam- 
ine agencies claimed to be irrevocable because 
coupled with an interest, and are inclined to rule 
against them. 

MASTER AND SERVANT.â€” As we have said, 
the function of the servant is to perform ministerial 
or mechanical acts for the master. The chief subject- 
matter under the law of principal and agent is con- 
tracts, while the chief subject-matter of the law of 
master and servant is tort. The servant, in perform- 
ing acts for his master, may, inadvertently or wil- 
fully, cause injury to a third person or to the prop- 
erty of a third person. The question arises : What is 
the master's responsibility? We shall consider this 
from two standpoints; the relationship of the master 
and servant, inter se (between themselves), and the 



150 COMMERCIAL LAW 

relationship of the master and servant as to the out- 
side world. For example: the driver of a delivery 
truck, operated by Lord & Taylor, negligently runs 
over a pedestrian. The truck was going at the rate 
of tv/enty-five miles an hour, although the instruc- 
tions issued by Lord & Taylor to all their servants 
is not to run cars more than fifteen miles per hour 
in the congested parts of New York City. Is Lord 
& Taylor liable to the pedestrian? This question in- 
volves the relationship of master and servant as to 
outside parties. The same servant, while operating 
the delivery truck for Lord & Taylor is run into, neg- 
ligently, by a delivery truck operated by R. H. Macy 
& Co. Is the master. Lord & Taylor, responsible to 
its servant for the injury which he suffers as the result 
of the collision? This question involves the relation- 
ship of master and servant inter se. We shall con- 
sider this latter relationship first. 

THE COMMON LAW GOVERNING THE 
RELATIONSHIP OF MASTER AND SERVANT 
INTER SE.â€” What is the liability of the master to- 
wards the servant if the servant is injured? We shall 
see in the chapter on torts that a tort is defined to be 
a breach of duty imposed by law for which a suit for 
damages may be maintained. Hence it follows that 
the master's liability in tort flows from a breach of 
duty owed by him to his servant. If there is no legal 
duty, correspondingly there is no legal liability. 
These legal duties which the common law developed 
over a long period of years may be summed up as 
follows: (1) To provide a reasonably safe place for 



COMMERCIAL LAW 151 

the servant to work. (2) To provide reasonably safe, 
suitable, and sufficient tools and appliances with 
which the servant is to perform his work. (3) To 
provide reasonably careful and competent fellow 
workmen and in sufficient number for the work in 
hand. (4) To warn the servant of any unusual dan- 
gers connected with the work. (5) Generally so to 
conduct the work as not to expose the servant to 
dangers which could be avoided by the exercise of 
reasonable diligence. From the servant's standpoint, 
it was said that he assumed the ordinary risks in- 
herent to the kind of business in which he was em- 
ployed. These rules of the common law were the 
outgrowth of conditions surrounding the small shop 
and involving the use of simple or no machinery. 
Under modern industrial conditions they have proved 
wholly inadequate. We have been unduly conserva- 
tive in recognizing this. Strangely enough the Work- 
men's Compensation Acts, with which we are now so 
familiar, had their origin in Germany in 1884. Nearly 
all the countries of continental Europe recognized the 
situation about thirty years ago, and England in 1897, 
and the United States within the last few years. 

THE OBJECTION OF THE COMMON LAW 
THEORY.â€” Under the old theory, if the master had 
observed the duties which we have mentioned, he 
had performed his whole obligation to his own ser- 
vant; thus, if two fellow workmen were working on 
the twentieth story of a new steel skyscraper being 
erected by the Institute Construction Co., and 
through the carelessness of servant A, servant B was 



152 COMMERCIAL LAW 

precipitated to the street and killed, there would be 
no recovery on the part of the estate of the deceased 
servant, although he may have left a wife and several 
children dependent wholly upon him for support. 
Even admitting that the Institute Construction Co. 
had exercised due care in selecting competent fellow 
servants for the deceased to work with, and had, 
therefore, performed all of its obligations on this 
score, nevertheless, it is better, from the standpoint of 
society, that the wife and children of servant B should 
receive fair compensation rather than be thrown up- 
on the mercy of the public. The great object of the 
Workmen's Compensation Act is to shift the burden 
of such economic waste from the employer to the in- 
dustry, in order that it may ultimately be borne by 
the consumer as a part of the necessary cost of con- 
struction and production. Thus we are asking the 
master to assume a greater financial responsibility 
for injuries to his servant under this new theory than 
he has assumed heretofore. This can be taken care of 
by the increased price he charges for his work and 
this in turn will ultimately pass the added burden to 
the community at large. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” Again, even if the servant 
did have a cause of action against his master, because 
of the master's failure to observe the common law re- 
quirements we have mentioned, nevertheless, the ex- 
pense of litigation and the interminable delays con- 
nected with it, amounting at times to two or three 
yearsbefore the case was finally disposed of by the court 
of last resort, all tended to make litigation for the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 153 

servant all but impossible. He would ordinarily have 
no money with which to begin this long litigation, 
and would be obliged to retain the services of a law- 
yer, who would take the case on a contingent fee 
basis, and often take from the workman, should the 
decision finally be in his favor, a third, a half, or even 
a greater portion of the amount that he recovers. 
Perhaps this was no greater compensation than the 
lawyer was entitled to because of the labor involved 
and the prospect of no pay if he lost the case, but re- 
gardless 'of this it was hard on the client. The 
Supreme Court of Washington, in the case of Stertz 
V. The Industrial Insurance Commission, 91 Wash. 
588, has summed up the objections against the whole 
system as follows : "Both had suffered under the old 
system, the employers by heavy judgments of which 
half was opposing lawyers' booty, the workmen 
through the old defenses or exhaustion in wasteful 
litigation. Both wanted peace. The master in ex- 
change for limited liability was willing to pay on 
some claims in future where in the past there had 
been no liability at all. The servant was willing not 
only to give up trial by jury but to accept far less than 
he had often won in court, provided he was sure to 
get the small sum without having to fight for it. . . . 
To win only after litigation, to collect only after the 
employment of lawyers, to receive the sum only after 
months or years of delay, was to the comparatively 
indigent claimant little better than to get nothing. 
The workmen wanted a system entirely new. It is 
but fair to admit that they had become impatient with 



154 COMMERCIAL LAW 

the courts of law. They knew, and both economists 
and progressive jurists were pointing out, what is 
now generally conceded, that two generations ought 
never to have suffered from the baleful judgments of 
Abinger and Shaw." 

WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT.â€” To 
meet the objections we have just mentioned, the 
workmen's compensation act principle was developed 
on the continent of Europe. Practically all of con- 
tinental Europe had placed laws of this character on 
its statute books before the end of the nineteenth 
century; in 1906 England passed similar legislation, 
and within the last few years, we have adopted the 
same principles. With the exception of a few Southern 
States, every State and territory of the United States 
has a Workmen's Compensation Act. We cannot 
consider these acts in detail. The principle underly- 
ing them is the same throughout the country. They 
are designed to compensate servants for "accidents'* 
"arising out of," and "during the course of" their em- 
ployment, and this, regardless of whether the servant 
was at fault or not. The whole theory of the common 
law had been that the master must be at fault in order 
that the servant may recover. The new theory is that 
the community at large can better stand the loss suf- 
fered by a servant than the individual servant. For 
example : a steel girder falls upon a workman engaged 
in structural steel work, through no fault on his part 
and also through no fault on the part of his employer. 
Under the common law, he would have to stand the 
loss himself. Under the Workmen's Compensation 



COMMERCIAL LAW 155 

Act, such an event is an "accident" ; it "arose out of" 
and "in the course of" his employment. Therefore, 
he is entitled to a fixed compensation, and he secures 
it almost immediately through a workmen's compen- 
sation bureau, or whatever body the act of the par- 
ticular State creates for the purpose of settling such 
matters. This is a burden on the employer, it is true; 
he was in no way to blame. Neither was the work- 
man. The employer may protect himself against the 
claims of his workmen by insurance under a plan pro- 
vided by the State law, or if the State law does not 
provide for it, by arrangements with private compa- 
nies the same as any other accident insurance is ob- 
tained, and by figuring his cost upon the particular 
job, he can charge as a part of his operating expense, 
the cost of his insurance and include that in his charge 
for work. The loss suffered by the individual work- 
men is then passed to the community at large. From 
an economical and sociological standpoint, this situa- 
tion is undoubtedly better than that existing under 
the theory of the common law. 

THE INTERPRETATION OF WORKMEN'S 
COMPENSATION ACTS.â€” Although these acts 
are comparatively new in this country, there has been 
a great amount of litigation, and it is not practical to 
enter into a discussion of all the close questions which 
are raised in interpreting such acts. A vast amount 
of the litigation has been concerned with the inter- 
pretation of the three expressions, common to almost 
all the acts, "accident" "arising out of" and "during 
the course of." While the courts have shown a broad- 



156 COMMERCIAL LAW 

minded spirit in interpreting these expressions, it is 
undoubtedly true that some decisions will suggest 
further legislation in order to correct certain evils 
which exist at the present time. For example, in de- 
fining the term "accident," the leading English case 
said : "The expression 'accident' is used in the public 
and ordinary sense of the word, as denoting an un- 
looked-for event which is not expected or designed." 
And Judge Siebecker of Wisconsin says "accidental" 
contemplates "an event not within one's foresight and 
expectation, resulting in a mishap causing injury to 
the employee," and Mr. Justice Pound of New York 
says that the statute contemplates injuries "not ex- 
pected or designed by the workman himself." To 
illustrate: A window-dresser is decorating the win- 
dow in Woolworth's. He swallows a pin. This is 
an "accident" within the contemplation of the act, 
and entitles him to recovery. Again, a workman is 
employed in a white-lead factory. During his six 
months period of service in the factory, he contracts 
tuberculosis. This is not an "accident" because you 
must be able to put your finger upon a definite time 
when the unlooked-for event happened. This leads 
us to the general statement that Workmen's Com- 
pensation Acts in this country, as at present drawn, 
do not generally cover occupational diseases. Sep- 
arate legislation is undoubtedly desirable to extend 
the principle in such cases, for if it is sound that the 
window-dresser in Woolworth's should recover, it 
should be equally sound that the workman who con- 
tracted tuberculosis should recover. Again, the other 



COMMERCIAL LAW 157 

two expressions "arising out of," and "during the 
course of" have caused much litigation. Perhaps the 
most satisfactory statement about these expressions 
is in the leading Massachusetts case, In re McNicol, 
215 Mass. 497. Here the court says: "The injury 
must both arise 'out of and also be received *in the 
course of the employment. Neither alone is enough. 
It is not easy * * * ^q give a comprehensive defini- 
tion of these words. * * * An injury is received 'in 
the course of the employment when it comes while 
the workman is doing the duty which he is employed 
to perform. It 'arises out of the employment, when 
there is * * * a causal connection between the con- 
ditions under which the work is required to be per- 
formed and the resulting injury. * * * jf ^j^g injury 
can be seen * * * to have been contemplated by a 
reasonable person familiar with the whole situation, 
* * * then it arises 'out of* the employment. * * * 
The causative danger must be peculiar to the work 
and not common to the neighborhood. * * * j^ need 
not have been foreseen or expected, but after the 
event it must appear to have had its origin in a risk 
connected with the employment, and to have flowed 
from that source as a rational consequence." An il- 
lustration will show how these phrases are applied. 
The janitor of a building is alone in the building. An 
old enemy who has not seen him for years, learns his 
whereabouts, comes into the building, shoots him in 
the leg, causing him to have it amputated. Is the mas- 
ter liable? It is an "accident," and clearly it arose "dur- 
ing the course of" employment, but did it arise "out 



158 COMMERCIAL LAW 

of" his employment? Manifestly not. The guilty 
party would have shot the man had he met him in 
Central Park, or any other place. It was purely per- 
sonal vengeance on his part which caused the act. The 
night watchman in a bank is shot by a robber at night 
in the bank, while on duty. May he recover from his 
master? Clearly he can. It is an "accident." It arose 
"during the course of" his employment, it arose "out 
of" his employment also, because the robber would 
not have shot him were he not in the bank as a watch- 
man, standing between the robber and the accomplish- 
ment of his purpose, the securing of money from the 
bank. 

THE RELATIONSHIP OF MASTER AND 
SERVANT AS RELATING TO OUTSIDE 
PARTIES. â€” If the relationship of master and servant 
exists, the question arises, is the master responsible 
for the torts committed by his servant, resulting in 
injury to third parties? It is, of course, essential that 
the wrongdoer must be the defendant's servant. It 
does not follow that a wrongdoer is the defendant's 
servant simply because of a certain relationship, as 
that of parent and child, husband and vAie, or em- 
ployer and employee. Within the last few years, a 
great number of automobile cases have been decided 
by the courts, and they are commonly spoken of as the 
"family automobile cases." To illustrate : I own a car 
which is used by the various members of my family. 
My son, while running the car, for his own pleasure, 
negligently runs over some one. Am I responsible? 
Grantinp^ the relationship of parent and child, that 



COMMERCIAL LAW 159 

would not constitute, per se (of itself), the relation- 
ship of master and servant. The injured man would 
have to show more than I have indicated in order to 
entitle him to recover for my son's negligence. Were 
members of my family in the car, being taken out for a 
ride by my son, I would be liable. Again, my wife, in 
discharging a servant, assaults her. Should the mere 
fact of the relationship of husband and wife make me 
liable on the theory of master and servant? Clearly 
not. Again, I employ John Smith as my chauffeur. I 
never operate my car on Sunday. John Smith, who 
lives in the town adjoining mine, is moving, and asks 
if he may borrow my car over Sunday to assist in the 
moving operations. While using the car for that pur- 
pose, he negligently runs over some one. Am I liable? 
Clearly not, for, although the relationship of master 
and servant exists between me and my servant at the 
time he did the injury, he was not acting for me as a 
servant. What is the rule to be applied to answer such 
questions? 

THE SERVANT MUST BE ENGAGED IN 
HIS MASTER'S BUSINESS.â€” It is clear from the 
foregoing that, in order to make the master liable, the 
servant must be engaged in his master's business, and 
he must be acting within the scope of his employment. 
The New York case of Rounds v. The Delaware, etc.. 
Railroad, 64 N. Y. 129, states the general rule: "For 
the acts of the servant, within the general scope of 
his employment, while engaged in his master's busi- 
ness, and done with a view to the furtherance of that 
business and the master's interest, the master will be 



160 COMMERCIAL LAW 

responsible whether the act be done negligently, wan- 
tonly, or even wilfully." The Court of Errors and Ap- 
peals of New Jersey recently said in Holler v. Sanford 
Ross, 68 N. J. Law, 324: *'The Supreme Court of Con- 
necticut states the rule applicable to this class of cases 
about as clearly as it can be done, when it says : *For 
all acts done by a servant in obedience to the express 
orders or direction of the master, or in the execution 
of the master's business, within the scope of his em- 
ployment, and for acts in any sense warranted by the 
express or implied authority conferred upon him, con- 
sidering the nature of the service required, the instruc- 
tions given and the circumstances under which the act 
is done, the master is responsible ; for acts which are 
not within these conditions, the servant alone is re- 
sponsible.' " 

LIABILITY OF A PUBLIC AGENCY FOR 
THE NEGLIGENT ACTS OF ITS AGENTS.â€” It 
is an old saying that "the King can do no wrong." 
This principle of the English common law we have 
applied in this country, and the Federal Government 
cannot be sued unless it gives its consent. While the 
Court of Claims has been established, Congress has 
generally provided that suits may be brought against 
the Federal Government only in contract actions, and 
not in tort actions, so that ordinarily, if a person is 
injured through the negligence of an employee of the 
Federal Government, he may not recover against that 
Government. Thus, my only remedy in case of an 
injury, received through the negligent operation of an 
elevator in a post-office building owned by the Gov- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 161 

ernment, would be the passing of special legislation by 
Congress compensating me. I would have no right to 
sue the United States for such injury. The same gen- 
eral principles are applied to the State governments. 
In regard to cities, the rule may be generally stated to 
be that a municipality is not liable for the negligence 
of its servants in those departments operated by the 
municipality in its governmental activities, as distin- 
guished from its administrative activities, in which 
case it is liable. Thus, a city is not responsible for the 
negligence of its policemen or its firemen, although 
injury results from their negligence, these depart- 
ments being examples of governmental activities of 
a municipality, while the city would be liable, gener- 
ally, for the negligence of the employees of its water 
department, this being an illustration of its adminis- 
trative activities. It is also generally held that public 
charities, such as hospitals, and the like, are not liable 
for torts committed by their servants, provided they 
have used reasonable care in the selection of their 
servants. 

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.â€”A dis- 
tinction must be made between one whom we call an 
independent contractor and a master. When A de- 
sires a particular piece of work done, he has two 
options as to doing it. He may either hire a workman 
to do it, retaining control of the workman, and telling 
him how he shall do it, or he may let the work by con- 
tract, simply stipulating that it shall be done in accor- 
dance with plans and specifications which his archi- 
tect has drawn up. He retains no control over the 



162 COMMERCIAL LAW 

contractor or over his method of work. His sole in- 
terest here is to have the piece of work turned over 
to him in its completed state. In the first case, we call 
the workman a servant; in the second case, he is an 
independent contractor. One who employs an inde- 
pendent contractor is not liable for the negligent acts 
of the contractor or his servants, except in a few spe- 
cial cases. In Berg v. Parsons, 156 N. Y. 109, the 
majority of the court states: ''There are certain excep- 
tional cases where a person employing a contractor is 
liable, which, briefly stated, are: "Where the employer 
personally interferes with the work, and the acts per- 
formed by him occasion the injury; where the thing 
contracted to be done is unlawful ; where the acts per- 
formed create a public nuisance; and where an em- 
ployer is bound by a statute to do a thing efficiently 
and an injury results from its inefficiency." A few, 
but not many courts, add to this list one further fact, 
that the emplo3/er must use due care in the selection 
of a competent independent contractor, otherwise he 
is liable. This would seem eminently sound. 



CHAPTER V 



Partnership 

RELATIONS ANALOGOUS TO PRINCIPAL 
AND AGENT.â€” There are a few relations, in 
the law, which are analogous to that of prin- 
cipal and agent. The one which we shall take up now 
is the relationship of a partner to a partnership, and 
also to the outside world. We shall consider in a sub- 
sequent chapter, the functions, duties and responsibil- 
ities of trustees, executors, and administrators. 

THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTNERSHIP 
LAW.â€” There is a very common impression that 
partnership law is not as important now as formerly. 
This undoubtedly is true, as more and more large 
business enterprises are being conducted in the cor- 
poration form; but there is still a large amount of 
business done in the partnership form. What is 
most important, however, is the very infor- 
mality of the type of business conducted under 
the partnership arrangement. "Whether, in a given 
case, a partnership exists, becomes a vital ques- 
tion. Two friends, A and B, in an informal way, 
go into a business venture. The enterprise fails and 
A and B owe many debts. A has some property of 
his own; B has nothing. You are a creditor, but all 
your dealings have been with B. One simple point 
will show you whether your claim is worthless. If 
A and B were partners, you may hold A, If they 

163 



164 COMMERCIAL LAW 

were not partners, your claim probably never will be 
worth anything to you. The question, then, whether 
or not a certain relationship constitutes a partner- 
ship is a most important one, in the field of commer- 
cial law. 

PARTNERSHIP DEFINED.â€” We shall have 
occasion, in the chapters on bills and notes, and per- 
sonal property, to refer to the movement to codify 
certain branches of the law. This movement was 
begun by the Commissioners on Uniform Laws pro- 
posing the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Act, 
which has now been adopted in all of the States except 
Georgia. One of the most recent codifications is the 
Uniform Partnership Act which has been adopted in 
a number of the States, and which will undoubtedly 
follow the same course as the other acts drawn by the 
same Commissioners. We shall make frequent refer- 
ence to the Uniform Partnership Act in this chapter. 
Although some of the writers on the law of partner- 
ship state that no satisfactory definition of the term 
partnership can be given, the Uniform Act defines it 
as follows: "A partnership is an association of two 
or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business 
for profit." It is undoubtedly true that even with 
this definition, a considerable amount of further ex- 
planation will be necessary to determine with any de- 
gree of certainty, just what is meant by partner- 
ship. 

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PART- 
NERSHIP AND A CORPORATION.â€” While we 
may be anticipating our chapter on corporations, it 



COMMERCIAL LAW 165 

is well, at the very outset, to understand the funda- 
mental differences between a partnership and a cor- 
poration. We may mention six differences: 

(1) When a partner dies, the partnership is auto- 
matically dissolved. If a partner sells or transfers 
his interest in the business, this works a dissolution 
of the firm. On the other hand, the situation is pre- 
cisely the opposite in the case of a corporation. The 
death of a shareholder has no effect upon the cor- 
poration. In fact, if all of the shareholders of the 
United States Steel Corporation should die at once, 
the corporation would still exist. So also the transfer 
of stock from one owner to another has no effect upon 
the corporation's existence. Many thousand shares 
are dealt with on the exchange each day without the 
slightest effect upon any corporation. 

(2) The doctrine of individual liability for the 
debts of a firm is a fundamental characteristic of 
partnership law. Each member of the firm is abso- 
lutely liable for all the debts of the firm. Thus, if 
the firm consists of A, B, and C, and the firm goes 
into bankruptcy and owes $50,000, and B and C are 
both individually worthless, and A has his own pri 
vate fortune, A will be obliged to pay all of the debts, 
although, according to the arrangements that the 
partners made when forming the partnership, each 
was to share the profits and losses equally. Theoret- 
ically, A has the right to contribution from his fellow 
partners, and should they later acquire property, he 
will be able to enforce this right in a court of equity. 
In a corporation, a shareholder is liable only for the 



166 COMMERCIAL LAW 

value of his share. If he subscribes to a share of stock, 
par value $100, and has paid only $50 on his sub- 
scription, and the corporation goes into bankruptcy, 
its receiver can compel him to pay the balance of his 
subscription, $50, but that would be the extent of 
his loss. If I buy a share of United States Steel 
Common, at $79, on the exchange, and the compan}' 
goes into bankruptcy, my loss v^ill be only $79. I 
would not be obliged to make up to the receiver the 
other twenty-one dollars. The only noteworthy ex- 
ception to this rule as to the liability of a stockholder 
is in the case of a shareholder in a National bank, 
(this is true of some of the State banking laws also), 
where a shareholder is liable to an extra assessment 
equal to the par value of the stock he owns. 

(3) In a partnership each member of the firm is 
a general agent for the partnership, and his acts bind 
the firm. In the case of a corporation, a shareholder, 
by virtue of the fact that he is a shareholder, has no 
power to bind the corporation. The position of a 
shareholder is very similar to that of a voter. The 
corporation is run by its board of directors. They 
are elected by the shareholders just as we elect a 
governor or president. If we are dissatisfied with 
the conduct of a governor or president, all we can do 
is to vote him out of office at the next election, except 
in unusual cases where a governor or president might 
be impeached. The same is true in the case of a 
board of directors. 

(4) A partnership may be created by a formal 
contract, or a simple contract, in writing or by word 



COMMERCIAL LAW 167 

of mouth ; in fact it may be created in almost any way. 
A corporation, in order to do business, mxust comply 
with the corporation lav/s of the State in v/hich it is 
incorporated. A regular formality must be observed. 
A certificate of incorporation must be filed, generally 
with the Secretary of State, and with the county clerk 
of the county in which the corporation's principal 
place of business is located in the State. 

(5) A partnership may do anything that is legal 
and which the members decide to do. A corporation 
exists by virtue of a charter, granted by the State. 
The sum total of the powers given in that charter 
gives the total of all of the activities the corporation 
may undertake. Engagement in activities not author- 
ized in the charter may result in the forfeiture of the 
charter by the State. 

(5) In legal theory, a corporation is looked upon 
as a separate entity. Most States require at least 
three persons to incorporate. A, B and C form a 
corporation under the laws of the State of New York. 
There are then four legal persons in existence : A, B, 
and C, and this separate person, or legal entity, the 
Green Corporation, if that is the name given the com- 
pany. In the case of a partnership, the law does not, 
as a rule, consider the partnership as an entity dis- 
tinct and separate from the members who make up 
the firm. Of course, the business man does, in a way, 
look upon the partnership as a separate commercial 
entity. The very fact that the members of the firm 
are all general agents for the firm, and that the mem- 
bers are individually liable for all of the debts of the 



168 COMMERCIAL LAW 

firm, shows that the law does not carry the entity 
theory into practice in partnerships as it does in cor- 
porations. 

DIFFERENT KINDS OF PARTNERSHIP.â€” 
What we have said appHes to the ordinary partner- 
ship. There are certain forms of partnership which 
we can only mention. One of them is the limited 
partnership. Limited partnerships are created under 
the law of the State in which the business is to be 
conducted and in a general way, these limited part- 
nerships are a combination of the principles under- 
lying ordinary partnerships and corporations. The 
members may limit their liability to a certain amount, 
and in that sense, the limited partnership is like a cor- 
poration. On the other hand, the general principles 
of partnership, as we shall discuss them, apply with 
almost equal force to the acts of a limited partnership. 
A person should not undertake to give an opinion as 
to a legal problem relating to a limited partnership 
until the law of the State in which the limited part- 
nership is organized has been consulted. 

JOINT STOCK COMPANIES.â€” Occasionally 
we meet with organizations â€” joint stock companies â€” 
which occupy a sort of "No-man's land" between 
partnerships and corporations. The joint stock com- 
pany issues shares of stock the same as a corporation. 
These shares are listed on the stock exchange, as for 
example, the Adams Express Company. The joint 
stock company, however, carries with it the individual 
liability of the shareholders for the debts of the com- 
pany, which is technically a partnership attribute. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 169 

The New York Court of Appeals in People ex rel. 
Winchester v. Coleman, 133 N. Y. 279, has put it this 
way: "More or less, they crowd upon and overlap 
each other, but without losing their identity, and so, 
while we cannot say that a joint stock company is a 
corporation, we can say * * * that the joint stock 
company is a partnership with some of the powers of 
a corporation/* 

HOW TO DETERMINE WHETHER A 
PARTNERSHIP EXISTS.â€” In a case, not tried in 
court, the facts were : A Gloucester cod-fishing vessel 
made an unsuccessful fishing voyage. The sailors 
were to secure a certain portion of the profits of the 
voyage as their wages. When the ship returned to 
port, an attempt was made to collect bills incurred on 
the trip and to hold the seamen liable along with the 
owners of the vessel, as partners. It was contended 
that sharing in the profits made them partners. While 
this is true generally, this particular custom, whereby 
a laborer receives a certain portion of the profits of 
an undertaking as his wages, does not of itself con- 
stitute him a partner with the person operating the 
vessel. This point has been decided several times. 
Such questions as these arise and cause great diffi- 
culty in determining whether a partnership exists. 
At times it is very important, as in the case of the 
seamen, to know whether or not they can be made 
to assume the obligations pertaining to the partner- 
ship relations. While we cannot go into these rela- 
tions in detail, the framers of the Uniform Partner- 
ship Act have laid down, with the utmost care, the 



170 COMMERCIAL LAW 

rules which are to be used in determining whether a 
partnership exists or not. But, you say, why cannot 
the parties avoid all this difficulty by making a 
written agreement clearing up the entire matter? 
They could. It is the simplest matter in the world. 
But the trouble comes because a partnership arrange- 
ment is so easy to enter into, and requires so little 
formality, that it is taken for granted that it will come 
out satisfactorily, and the precautions which should 
be taken are sometimes forgotten. Hence, we have 
to have rules of interpretation to help us when the 
parties themselves have not taken the necessary pre- 
cautions to make matters clear. These rules of in- 
terpretation are very clearly and very definitely laid 
down in the Uniform Partnership Act, in the follow- 
ing language: 

(1) Except as provided by Section 16, persons 
who are not partners as to each other are not partners 
as to third persons. 

(2) Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy 
by the entireties, joint property, common property, 
or part ownership does not of itself establish a part- 
nership, whether such co-owners do or do not share 
any profits made by the use of the property. 

(3) The sharing of gross returns does not of 
itself establish a partnership, whether or not the per- 
sons sharing them have a joint or common right or 
interest in any property from which the returns are 
derived. 

(4) The receipt by a person of a share of the 
profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he 



COMMERCIAL LAW 171 

is a partner in the business, but no such inference 
shall be drawn if such profits were received in pay- 
ment : 

(a) As a debt by installments or otherwise, 

(b) As wages of an employee or rent to a land- 
lord, 

(c) As an annuity to a widow or representative 
of a deceased partner, 

(d) As interest on a loan, though the amount of 
payment vary with the profits of the business, 

(e) As the consideration for the sale of the good- 
will of a business or other property by installments 
or otherwise. 

Section 16. â€” (Partner by estoppel.) â€” (1) When 
a person by words spoken or written or by conduct, 
represents himself, or consents to another represent- 
ing him to any one, as a partner in an existing part- 
nership or with one or more persons not actual part- 
ners, he is liable to any such person to whom such 
representation has been made, who has, on the faith 
of such representation, given credit to the actual or 
apparent partnership, and if he has made such repre- 
sentation or consented to its being made in a public 
manner, he is liable to such person, whether the repre- 
sentation has or has not been made or communicated 
to such person * * *. 

FOR WHAT PURPOSES MAY A PARTNER- 
SHIP BE CREATED.â€” A partnership may be 
created to carry on any lawful business, and whatever 
the individuals may do lawfully as such, two or more 
may do together in a group as a partnership. Pro- 



172 COMMERCIAL LAW 

fessional occupations may be carried on in the part- 
nership form advantageously. This is one case where 
a partnership has an advantage over a corporation. 
A group of lawyers may form a partnership and do 
business under a partnership name. But a group of 
lawyers seldom or never form corporations to prac- 
tice law. The reason for this is that the corporation 
is a separate entity, and the corporation as such can- 
not pass a bar examination and be admitted to the 
bar. In fact, in a few States, there are statutes pro- 
hibiting a corporation from practicing law. There 
is, therefore, very little advantage in creating a cor- 
poration which cannot itself do the thing for which it 
was created. 

ILLEGAL OBJECT.â€” A partnership which is 
formed to carry on any illegal purpose is, of course, 
not recognized by law. Thus, if A, B, and C form a 
partnership to engage in the gambling business and 
they elect C as treasurer and have a successful busi- 
ness so that they have a large amount of money on 
hand, A and B may not be able to reap the profits of 
the venture. C has the money. The agreement was 
that all were to share equally, but C insists on keep- 
ing it all. The law will allow him to do so, because 
it is beneath the dignity of the court to order an 
accounting in a transaction where all parties are 
equally guilty. The maxim is "in pari delicto, con- 
dicio defendentis potior est", that is, where the parties 
are in equal fault, the position of the defendant is the 
stronger. C, the guilty party, has the money; he is 
the defendant, therefore, he keeps it. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 173 

WHO MAY BE PARTNERS.â€” At common 
law, a married woman was incapable of becoming a 
member of a partnership because of her general in- 
capacity to enter a contract. Statutes removing the 
disability of married women have been passed in prac- 
tically all the States, and a married woman is gen- 
erally free to become a partner, except, and this is 
true in many States still, husband and wife may not 
become partners. An infant may be a member of a 
firm on the same general principles as applied to ordi- 
nary infant's contracts. His entering the partner- 
ship agreement is not void, but voidable. When he 
becomes of age, if he afBrms the contract of partner- 
ship, he will be liable the same as an adult. He has, 
however, the right to disaffirm his partnership agree- 
ment within a reasonable time after becoming of age, 
and if he does so, he will be absolved from all per- 
sonal liability for the debts of the firm. It is very 
generally held that a corporation may not enter into 
a copartnership with another corporation or an indi- 
vidual. The reason for this is a general rule of public 
policy that in a partnership the corporation would be 
bound by the acts of persons who are not its duly 
appointed agents and officers. There may be any 
number of members in a firm, such matters being left 
to the choice and wisdom of those operating the busi- 
ness. 

DELECTUS PERSONARUM. â€” While the 
foregoing is true, one must not reach the conclusion 
that an objectionable person may be forced into a 
firm. I am a member of a firm of three persons. I 



174 COMMERCIAL LAW 

decide to withdraw, and tell my two fellow partners 
that I have transferred all my interest in the firm to 
John Jones. He will take my place. My two fellow 
partners believe Jones to be a crook, and do not wish 
to be in partnership with him. They would not be 
obliged to accept him. In other words, the doctrine 
of delectus personarum, or the choice of the person, 
is strictly applied in partnership, because a partner- 
ship relation is a very confidential relationship. Ordi- 
narily the business cannot be conducted satisfactorily 
unless all of the partners have the confidence of each 
other. It is for this reason, that we have the rule, 
heretofore referred to, that the sale by a partner of 
his interest in the business works a dissolution of the 
partnership. John Jones, who purchased my rights 
in the firm, could not compel the other members to 
take him in, but the firm would have to be wound up 
and he would simply be able to recover what my share 
of the assets was. It is true that Section 27 of the 
Act does read that a sale by a partner of his interest 
does not of itself work a dissolution, but the doctrine 
of delectus personarum is fully preserved. That sec- 
tion reads: (1).A conveyance by a partner of his 
interest in the partnership does not of itself dissolve 
the partnership, nor, as against the other partners in 
the absence of agreement, entitle the assignee, during 
the continuance of the partnership, to interfere in the 
management or administration of the partnership 
business or affairs, or to require any information or 
account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the 
partnership books ; but it merely entitles the assignee 



COMMERCIAL LAW 175 

to receive in accordance with his contract the profits 
to which the assigning partner would otherwise be 
entitled. 

(2) In case of a dissolution of the partnership, 
the assignee is entitled to receive his assignor's inter- 
est and may require an account from the date only of 
the last account agreed to by all the partners. 

ARTICLES OF PARTNERSHIP.â€” We have 
learned that parties need not expressly declare them- 
selves partners, or enter into an express contract, in 
order to become partners. So the framing of written 
partnership articles â€” a written contract of partner- 
ship â€” is not essential, though it is the ordinary and 
advisable course. We may note here a few rules gov- 
erning the use and construction of such articles where 
they have been adopted. They should, of course, pro- 
vide for as m^any contingencies as can be foreseen, 
such as the nature, name and place of business, when 
the relation is to commence and when to terminate, 
what capital shall be contributed by each, what the 
share of each in the profits and losses shall be, what 
the powers of the partners as between themselves 
shall be, whether the business shall be continued after 
the death of one or more of the partners and how it 
shall be wound up. But the important thing to note 
is, that if provision be not made, the general law, and 
particularly that part governing the powers and 
duties of partners to each other and to third persons, 
applies. In other words, the partners may, by their 
contract, determine what their rights as between 
themselves shall be; but if they do not, the rules of 



176 COMMERCIAL LAW 

law will determine them. Thus they may determine 
that oÂ£ two partners one shall have two-thirds and 
the other one- third of the profits; in the absence of 
such a clause the law determines the profits shall be 
divided equally. When articles have been once 
adopted they can be changed only by the consent of 
all the partners; this consent need not be formally 
expressed in words, but it may be implied from a long- 
continued course of conduct. The law provides no 
means to force a partner to live up to his contract 
except in a very few cases ; the most it gives is a right 
of action for the breach caused by his failure to do as 
ai^reed. 

FIRM NAME.â€” The adoption of a firm name is 
not an essential to a partnership, but is customary and 
advisable. The names of the partners may be com- 
bined, or a single name used, or a fictitious name, or 
any name, so long as the rights of other persons are 
not violated. In some States, notably New York, the 
use of the name of a person not a partner is forbidden, 
as is also the use of the expression "& Co.," unless a 
partner is represented by it. Ordinarily, contracts 
may be made in the firm name and by one partner, 
but contracts under seal should be made in the names 
of the partners "doing business as," etc., and cannot 
be made by one partner without authority from the 
others. Conveyances of real property should be made 
to or by the individual partners "doing business as," 
etc., for the law does not generally recognize the firm 
as a separate person or entity sufficiently to enable it 
as such to take or give a conveyance. If the deed 



COMMERCIAL LAW 177 

ran to "John Doe & Co.," the title would be in John 
Doe only, though he would be said to hold it in trust 
for the firm, for if the partnership name is given as 
the grantee, the title goes only to those whose names 
appear, and if the partnership were doing business 
under a fictitious name, the deed would convey to no 
one. Whether land, the title to which is in the name 
of one partner, is held in trust by him as partnership 
property, is a question of intention, and that question 
is determined by asking with what money was the 
land bought, what use has it been put to, has it been 
carried on the books of the firm, with what money 
have the taxes, insurance, and other charges been 
paid, etc. If found to have been treated as partner- 
ship property, the fact that the title is in one person 
counts for little, as he will be said to hold it in trust 
for the firm ; but the careful business man will avoid 
trouble by having the property conveyed to the firm 
in the manner indicated, if it is actually partnership 
property. 

THE POWERS OF A PARTNER.â€” As a gen- 
eral agent, a partner has almost unlimited authority 
to bind the firm. Because of this, we have here one 
reason for not recommending the partnership form of 
doing business unless all the members of the firm 
have the utmost confidence in each other. These 
powers of the partners are so general that it is im- 
possible for us to go into them in any detail. They 
are summarized in the most compact form in the 
Uniform Partnership Act. Sections 9 to 17 of that 
act are as follows: 



178 COMMERCIAL LAW 

9. (1) Every partner is an agent of the partner- 
ship for the purpose of its business, and the act of 
every partner, including the execution in the partner- 
ship name of any instrument, for apparently carrying 
on in the usual way the business of the partnership of 
which he is a member, binds the partnership, unless 
the partner so acting has in fact no authority to act 
for the partnership in the particular matter, and the 
person with whom he is dealing has knowledge of the 
fact that he has no such authority. 

(2) An act of a partner, which is not apparently 
for the carrying on of the business of the partnership 
in the usual way, does not bind the partnership unless 
authorized by the other partners. 

(3) Unless authorized by the other partners or 
unless they have abandoned the business, one or 
more but less than all the partners have no authority 
to: 

(a) Assign the partnership property in trust 
for creditors or on the assignee's promise to pay 
the debts of the partnership, 

(b) Dispose of the good-will of the business, 

(c) Do any other act which would make it im- 
possible to carry on the ordinary business of the 
partnership, 

(d) Confess a judgment, 

(e) Submit a partnership claim or liability to 
arbitration or reference. 

(4) No act of a partner in contravention of a re- 
striction on his authority shall bind the partnership 
to persons having knowledge of the restriction. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 179 

10. (1) Where title to real property is in the 
partnership name, any partner may convey title to 
such property by a conveyance executed in the part- 
nership name; but the partnership may recover such 
property unless the partner's act binds the partner- 
ship under the provisions of paragraph (1) of Sec- 
tion 9, or unless such property has been conveyed by 
the grantee, or a person claiming through such 
grantee to a holder for value v^^ithout knowledge that 
the partner, in making the conveyance, has exceeded 
his authority. 

(2) Where title to real property is in the name 
of the partnership, a conveyance executed by a part- 
ner, in his own name, passes the equitable interest of 
the partnership, provided the act is one within the 
authority of the partner under the provisions of para- 
graph (1) of Section 9. 

(3) Where title to real property is in the name of 
one or more but not all the partners, and the record 
does not disclose the right of the partnership, the 
partners in whose name the title stands may convey 
title to such property, but the partnership may re- 
cover such property if the partners* act does not bind 
the partnership under the provisions of paragraph (1) 
of Section 9, unless the purchaser or his assignee, is 
a holder for value, without knowledge. 

(4) Where the title to real property is in the 
name of one or more or all the partners, or in a third 
person in trust for the partnership, a conveyance exe- 
cuted by a partner in the partnership name, or in his 
own name, passes the equitable interest of the part- 



180 COMMERCIAL LAW 

nership, provided the act is one within the authority 
of the partner under the provisions of paragraph (1) 
of Section 9. 

(5) Where the title to real property is in the 
names of all the partners, a conveyance executed by 
all the partners passes all their rights in such 
property. 

11. An admission or representation made by any 
partner concerning partnership affairs within the 
scope of his authority as conferred by this act is evi- 
dence against the partnership. 

12. Notice to any partner of any matter relating 
to partnership affairs, and the knowledge of the part- 
ner acting in the particular matter, acquired while a 
partner or then present to his mind, and the knowl- 
edge of any other partner who reasonably could and 
should have communicated it to the acting partner, 
operate as notice to or knowledge of the partnership, 
except in the case of a fraud on the partnership com- 
mitted by or with the consent of that partner. 

13. Where, by any wrongful act or omission of 
any partner acting in the ordinary course of the busi- 
ness of the partnership, or with the authority of his 
co-partners, loss or injury is caused to any person, 
not being a partner in the partnership, or any penalty 
is incurred, the partnership is liable therefor to the 
same extent as the partner so acting or omitting to 
act. 

14. The partnership is bound to make good the 
loss: 

(a) Where one partner acting within the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 181 

scope of his apparent authority receives money or 
property of a third person and misapplies it; and 
(b) Where the partnership in the course of its 
business receives money or property of a third per- 
son and the money or property so received is mis- 
appHed by any partner while it is in the custody of 
the partnership. 

15. All partners are liable 

(a) Jointly and severally for everything 
chargeable to the partnership under Sections 13 
and 14. 

(b) Jointly for all other debts and obligations 
of the partnership ; but any partner may enter into 
a separate obligation to perform a partnership con- 
tract. 

16. (1) When a person, by words spoken or 
written or by conduct, represents himself, or con- 
sents to another representing him to any one, as a 
partner in an existing partnership or with one or 
more persons not actual partners, he is liable to any 
such person to whom such representation has been 
made, who has, on the faith of such representation, 
given credit to the actual or apparent partnership, 
and if he has made such representation or consented 
to its being made in a public manner, he is liable to 
such person, whether the representation has or has 
not been made or communicated to such person so 
giving credit by or with the knowledge of the ap- 
parent partner making the representation or consent- 
ing to its being made. 

(a) When a partnership liability results, he is 



182 COMMERCIAL LAW 

liable as though he were an actual member of the 

partnership. 

(b) When no partnership liability results, he 

is liable jointly with the other persons, if any, so 

consenting to the contract or representation as to 

incur liability, otherwise separately. 

(2) When a person has been thus represented to 
be a partner in an existing partnership, or with one 
or more persons not actual partners, he is an agent 
of the persons consenting to such representation to 
bind them to the same extent and in the same manner 
as though he were a partner in fact, with respect to 
persons who rely upon the representation. Where 
all the members of the existing partnership consent 
to the representation, a partnership act or obligation 
results; but in all other cases it is the joint act or 
obligation of the person acting and the person con- 
senting to the representation. 

17. A person admitted as a partner into an exist- 
ing partnership is liable for all the obligations of the 
partnership arising before his admission as though he 
had been a partner when such obligations were in- 
curred, except that this liability shall be satisfied only 
out of partnership property. 

POWERS OF A MAJORITY OF PARTNERS. 
â€” If partners disagree, then a majority of them have 
power to decide what shall be done; but there are 
limits even to the power of a majority. They can 
only carry on the business of the firm, and any vote 
of the majority, or action of the majority, to change 
the character of the business for which the firm was 



COMMERCIAL LAW 183 

organized, or to make any fundamental change in 
the original articles of the partnership, would be 
invalid. 

RELATION OF PARTNERS TO ONE AN- 
OTHER. â€” The rules determining the rights and 
duties of partners in relation to the partnership are 
concisely but fully set forth in the Act as fol- 
lows: 

18. The rights and duties of the partners in rela- 
tion to the partnership shall be determined, subject to 
any agreement between them, by the following rules : 

(a) Each partner shall be repaid his contribu- 
tions, whether by way of capital or advances to the 
partnership property and share equally in the profits 
and surplus remaining after all liabilities, including 
those to partners, are satisfied; and must contribute 
towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise, 
sustained by the partnership according to his share 
in the profits. 

(b) The partnership must indemnify every part- 
ner in respect of payment made and personal liabili- 
ties reasonably incurred by him in the ordinary and 
proper conduct of its business, or for the preservation 
of its business or property. 

(c) A partner who, in aid of the partnership, 
makes any payment or advance beyond the amount 
of capital which he agreed to contribute, shall be paid 
interest from the date of the payment or advance. 

(d) A partner shall receive interest on the capi- 
tal contributed by him only from the date when repay- 
ment should be made. 



184 COMMERCIAL LAW 

(e) All partners have equal rights in the man- 
agement and conduct of the partnership business. 

(f) No partner is entitled to remuneration for 
acting in the partnership business, except that a sur- 
viving partner is entitled to reasonable compensation 
for his services in winding up the partnership 
affairs. 

(g) No person can become a member of a part- 
nership without the consent of all the partners. 

(h) Any difference arising as to ordinary mat- 
ters connected with the partnership business may be 
decided by a majority of the partners; but no act in 
contravention of any agreement between the part- 
ners may be done rightly without the consent of all 
the partners. 

19. The partnership books shall be kept, subject 
to any agreement between the partners, at the prin- 
cipal place of business of the partnership, and every 
partner shall at all times have access to and may in- 
spect and copy any of them. 

20. Partners shall render on demand true and 
full information of all things affecting the partner- 
ship to any partner or the legal representative of any 
deceased partner or partner under legal disability. 

21. (1) Every partner must account to the part- 
nership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any 
profits derived by him without the consent of the 
other partners from any transaction connected with 
the formation, conduct, or liquidation of the partner- 
ship or from any use by him of its property. 

(2) This section applies also to the representa- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 185 

tives of a deceased partner engaged in the liquidation 
of the affairs of the partnership as the personal repre- 
sentatives of the last surviving partner. 

22. Any partner shall have the right to a formal 
account as to partnership affairs: 

(a) If he is wrongfully excluded from the pait- 
nership business or possession of its property by his 
co-partners. 

(b) If the right exists under the terms of any 
agreement. 

(c) As provided by Section 21. 

(d) Whenever other circumstances renders it 
just and reasonable. 

TERMINATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP. 
â€” A partnership is terminated either by act of the 
partners, or by law. Under the first heading, we may 
mention such things as the partnership being ter- 
minated by the accomplishment of the object for 
which the same was formed, or by the termination 
of'the time during which the partnership was to exist, 
or by mutual consent of all parties concerned. Under 
the head of termination by operation of law, we have 
such topics as the death of a partner, the insanity of 
a partner, or the bankruptcy of a partner, and a disso- 
lution by a court, as for example, where it is abso- 
lutely certain, in the opinion of the court, that the 
business cannot be successfully continued longer. In 
such a case, although some of the partners may not 
wish to wind up the affairs of the business, the court 
may order it done in the interest of all parties con- 
cerned. 



186 COMMERCIAL LAW 

OWNERSHIP OF FIRM PROPERTY AND 
CREDITORS' RIGHTS.â€” The firm property is 
owned by all the partners jointly, but the interest of 
each individual partner is not an interest in each piece 
of firm property, but a right to have an accounting 
and to receive on the accounting such share of the 
assets as belong to him when all debts due from him 
to the firm and all liabilities to the outside world are 
settled. Consequently, a creditor of an individual 
partner cannot seize or attach or levy on firm prop- 
erty, because that firm property does not belong, nor 
does any part of it belong, to his debtor. The creditor 
must file a bill in equity asking that the partner's 
share be determined, and that on an accounting so 
much as is found due to the debtor partner be applied 
to discharge that partner's indebtedness. 

THE DIVISION OF ASSETS.â€” Upon final 
dissolution, the question of division of assets comes 
up, and the Uniform Partnership Act gives us the 
general rule as to how the firm's assets are divided. 
Section 40 of the Act reads: 

In settling accounts between the parties after 
dissolution, the following rules shall be observed, sub- 
ject to any agreement to the contrary: 

(a) The assets of the partnership are: 

I. The partnership property, 

II. The contributions of the partners neces- 
sary for the payment oÂ£ all the liabilities specified 
in clause (b) of this paragraph. 

(b) The liabilities of the partnership shall rank 
in order of payment, as follows : 



COMMERCIAL LAW 187 

I. Those owing to creditors other than part- 
ners, 

II. Those owing to partners other than for 
capital and profits, 

III. Those owing to partners in respect of 
capital, 

IV. Those owing to partners in respect of 
profits. 

(c) The assets shall be applied in the order of 
their declaration in clause (a) of this paragraph to 
the satisfaction of the liabilities. 

(d) The partners shall contribute, as provided 
by Section 18 (a) the amount necessary to satisfy the 
liabilities; but if any, but not all, of the partners are 
insolvent, or, not being subject to process, refuse to 
contribute, the other partners shall contribute their 
share of the liabilities, and, in the relative proportions 
in which they share the profits, the additional amount 
necessary to pay the liabilities. 

(e) An assignee for the benefit of creditors or 
any person appointed by the court shall have the right 
to enforce the contributions specified in clause (d) of 
this paragraph. 

(f ) Any partner or his legal representative shall 
have the right to enforce the contributions specified 
in clause (d) of this paragraph, to the extent of the 
amount which he has paid in excess of his share of 
the liability. 

(g) The individual property of a deceased part- 
ner shall be liable for the contributions specified in 
clause (d) of this paragraph. 



188 COMMERCIAL LAW 

(h) When partnership property and the indi- 
vidual properties of the partners are in the possession 
of a court for distribution, partnership creditors shall 
have priority on partnership property, and separate 
creditors on individual property, saving the rights of 
lien or secured creditors as heretofore. 

(i) Where a partner has become bankrupt or his 
estate is insolvent, the claims against his separate 
property shall rank in the following order: 

I. Those owing to separate creditors, 

II. Those owing to partnership creditors, 

III. Those owing to partners by way of con- 
tribution. 

LIQUIDATION OF PARTNERSHIP.â€” When 
a partnership is dissolved, it is common for the busi- 
ness to require liquidation, and frequently one or 
more of the partners are what are called liquidating 
partners. If a partnership is dissolved by death, for 
instance, the surviving partners have a right to be 
liquidating partners and liquidate the business. That 
means they may carry on existing contracts; they 
may dispose of the stock on hand to the best advan- 
tage. If this requires incidental purchases of new 
goods, they may be made, but in general, new busi- 
ness cannot be undertaken. The function of a liqui- 
dating partner is to satisfy existing contracts, reduce 
the property of the firm to cash, and then distribute 
it to those who are entitled to receive it. 

LIMITED PARTNERSHIP.â€” Statutes, as we 
have learned, in many States permit the formation 
of limited partnerships, the object of which is to 



COMMERCIAL LAW 189 

enable one or more partners to avoid unlimited lia- 
bility for debts. Partners in a general partnership 
are each liable, individually, for the full amount of 
the firm's indebtedness. If one partner is thus com- 
pelled to pay more than his share, he may seek redress 
by demanding contribution from his fellow partners, 
and if they are not solvent, he will not be able to 
secure reimbursement. If there is one solvent part- 
ner, for instance, and two other partners, both of 
whom become insolvent, the result will be that the 
first partner will have to pay the debts of the firm 
and will have no redress except such as he may be 
able to get from the insolvent estates of his two part- 
ners. Now, in a limited partnership a limited partner 
does not stand to lose any more than the amount of 
money he actually puts in the firm. In order to create 
a limited partnership it is necessary to sign a cer- 
tificate prepared for the purpose and stating the facts, 
file it in the office of the Secretary of State or other 
official, and also publish it so that the public may be 
informed of the circumstances and credit may not 
be given by the world at large to the firm on the 
assumption that the limited partner is a general part- 
ner. He puts a specified amount of money in the firm 
and that money may be reached by creditors of the 
firm, but they cannot hold him further liable. A good 
definition of a limited partnership follows : A limited 
partnership is one which consists of one or more per- 
sons called general partners and also one or more 
persons called special partners. Every general part- 
ner is an agent for the partnership in the transaction 



190 COMMERCIAL LAW 

of its business and has authority to do whatever is 
necessary to carry on such business in the ordinary 
manner. Every general partner is liable to third per- 
sons, jointly and severally, with his general co-part- 
ners for all of the oblip:ations of the partnership. A 
special partner may only advise as to the manage- 
ment of the partnership and he is liable for the obli- 
gations of the partnership only to the amount of 
capital invested by him therein. 

SILENT PARTNERS.â€” A silent partner must 
not be confused with a member oÂ£ a limited partner- 
ship. A silent partner is a general partner who takes 
no part in the active management of the business and 
frequently is a secret partner. A member of a limited 
partnership can never be a secret partner, since the 
terms of a limited partnership must be published. A 
member of a limited partnership should take no part 
in the management of the business, or he may render 
himself liable as a general partner. The limited part- 
nership law requires, moreover, that he must have 
exactly complied with the law by making out, filing 
and publishing a certificate. The statutes of the 
State should be consulted on this point and closely 
adhered to. 

LIMITED. â€” We often see also in print, so and 
so "Ltd." This does not mean a limited partnership. 
The word "limited" is used in the name of an English 
or Canadian company organized under the English 
or Canadian statutes, but such companies are rather 
analogous to corporations than to limited partner- 
ships. The liability in such companies is limited alto- 



COMMSECIAL LAW 191 

gether to the assets in the company's hands. There 
are no general partners. The liability of all stock- 
holders is limited. The English and Canadian law 
requires that the word Limited be added to the name, 
so that the public may not be deceived into believing 
that the company is a partnership. 



CHAPTER VI 



Corporations 

THE NATURE OF A CORPORATION.â€” The 
nature of a corporation is perhaps best under- 
stood by an illustration. In the case of Peo- 
ple's Pleasure Park Co. v. Rohleder, 109 Va. 439, the 
facts were as follows : There was a large tract of land 
divided up into a number of lots, and in each deed, 
when a lot was sold, there was a covenant providing 
that title to the real property should never vest in a 
person of African descent, or in a colored person. 
Later, after the lots had been sold, several of them 
were conveyed to a corporation composed exclusively 
of negroes. The corporation knew, when it pur- 
chased the tract of land, of this restriction in the deed, 
and the land was bought by it for the purpose of 
establishing an amusement park for colored people. 
Suit was brought in a court of equity to compel the 
cancellation of the deed to the corporation. Stated 
boldly, the decision of the Virginia court amounts to 
an assertion that a corporation has no color. In other 
words, the corporation is an entity separate and dis- 
tinct from its members, and so, although all the stock- 
holders in this corporation were colored, that did not 
make the corporation a colored person. Thus, if A, 
B, and C, as incorporators, organize the X Cor- 
poration, although they are the sole stockholders, 
there are four persons. A, B, C, and the X Cor- 
poration. 

192 



COMMERCIAL LAW 193 

THE ENTITY THEORY.â€” It may be doubted 
if any court would carry the entity theory to the ex- 
tent that it would allow an individual who was the 
owner of a piece of real estate, which he was not per- 
mitted by the deed to sell to negroes, to deliberately 
go to a prospective negro purchaser and say: "I can- 
not sell my property to you because of a restriction 
in the deed, but I will pay the necessary expenses, if 
you, with two of your friends, will form a corpora- 
tion to take title to this property, in which corpora- 
tion each of your friends will own one share and you 
the balance, thus retaining control yourself. I will 
then deed the property to the corporation and will 
thereby get around the covenant in my deed prevent- 
ing a, transfer to negroes." We must not allow the 
entity theory to work a manifest injustice, as was 
said in Erickson v. Revere Elevator Co., 110 Minn. 
443 : "Where the corporate form is used by individuals 
for the purpose of evading the law, or for the perpe- 
tration of fraud, the courts will not permit the legal 
entity to be interposed so as to defeat justice." 

RESULTS OF THE ENTITY THEORY.â€” 
Flowing from the entity theory is the result that the 
property of a corporation is ovmed by the corporation 
and not by the individual members. Therefore, all 
conveyances of such property, whether it is real prop- 
erty or personal property, must be made by the cor- 
poration, and cannot be made by the members or 
shareholders as individuals. It also follows that all 
suits against or by the corporation must be brought 
against the corporation or by the corporation as an 



194 COMMERCIAL LAW 

entity and not against the individual members. Again, 
a corporation may take property from one of its in- 
dividual members, and it may make a contract with 
one of them, and it may sue them and be sued by 
them. 

KINDS OF CORPORATIONS.â€” Corporations 
are divided into public, quasi-public, and private cor- 
porations. The private corporation is such as is cre- 
ated for private enterprises, such as manufacturing, 
banking, and trading corporations. Religious and 
eleemosynary corporations are also included in this 
classification. The public corporation is such as is 
created for the purposes of government, such as cities, 
towns, villages, and institutions founded by the State, 
and managed by it for governmental purposes. Quasi- 
public corporations are such as are engaged in a pri- 
vate business which is affected with a public interest, 
such as railroads, both steam and electric, gas com- 
panies, water companies, lighting companies, and the 
like. The public, and generally the quasi-public, cor- 
porations possess the right of eminent domain, that 
is, the right to take private property for public pur- 
poses upon payment of just compensation to the 
owner. It is the private corporation with which we 
are usually concerned in commercial law, and this 
chapter will be devoted largely to a discussion of that 
class. 

THE CREATION OF A CORPORATION.â€” A 
corporation must be created by legislative authority. 
Formerly, a corporation was created by special act of 
the legislature, but in recent years the growth in the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 195 

number of corporations, and also the political wire- 
pulling necessary to get an incorporation bill through 
a legislature, have resulted in the almost universal 
practice of having the legislature pass a general cor- 
poration act, and then without further reference to 
the legislature, any group of persons, of the requisite 
number, may become incorporated by complying with 
the provisions of such an act. The formation of cor- 
porations under the laws of most States is a simple 
process, requiring in general the preparation of an 
official document sometimes termed the "certificate 
of incorporation" or the "charter," which paper sets 
forth the facts which are required under the laws of 
the State wherein the corporation is to be formed. 
These laws, while not uniform, generally require a 
statement as to the name to be used by the corpora- 
tion, the names of the proposed directors and incor- 
porators, a statement of the general purposes or ob- 
jects of the corporation, the location of its principal 
office and place of business, how long it is to last, the 
amount of its authorized capital, the par value of its 
stock, as well as a statement in regard to any pre- 
ferred stock which may be contemplated. Other de- 
tails are sometimes required under the various State 
laws. This official document must generally be signed 
or executed by those persons who are the incorpo- 
rators of the corporation. As a rule, three or more 
incorporators are required, although in some States 
five is the minimum. This official document, after it 
has been duly executed, is usually to be filed in the 
office of the Secretary of State, and usually also in that 



196 COMMERCIAL LAW 

of the county clerk of the county wherein its principal 
office is to be. This procedure, however, is subject to 
some variations and the statutes of the State involved 
must always be closely followed. As soon as the of- 
ficial document has been properly filed and the other 
necessary steps taken the incorporators hold the first 
meeting and effect an organization, after which time 
the corporation is generally in a position to transact 
business, although in some States it is provided in 
effect that corporations should not commence busi- 
ness until a certain share of the capital has been paid 
into the corporation in cash. 

CITIZENSHIP OF A CORPORATION.â€” Al- 
though a corporation is a separate entity, entirely dis- 
tinct and apart from its members, such separate en- 
tity is not a citizen in the sense in which we use the 
term ordinarily. At a general election a corporation 
has no right to vote. Again, Article 4 Section 2, of 
the United States Constitution, provides that "citizens 
of each State shall be entitled to all of the privileges 
and immunities of citizens in the several States." A 
corporation is not a citizen in this sense. Hence a 
State may keep all insurance companies, incorporated 
outside of its area, from doing business in that State 
by discriminating legislation against foreign insur- 
ance corporations. Insurance is not looked upon as 
interstate commerce, about which the individual 
States may not legislate, and as a corporation is not a 
citizen within the meaning of Article 4, Section 2, 
such insurance companies have no redress. In one 
sense, however, a corporation is looked upon as a 



COMMERCIAL LAW 197 

citizen. Where a suit is between citizens of different 
States, and the amount involved is over the prescribed 
sum, either party may bring the action in the Federal 
courts, if he so desires, instead of in the State courts. 
In this sense, a corporation is to be regarded as if it 
were a citizen of the State in which it is created. 
If I live in New York and the American Tobacco Co. 
is incorporated in New Jersey, suit between us may 
be brought in the Federal courts on the ground of di- 
versity of citizenship on the part of plaintiff and de- 
fendant. 

POWERS OF CORPORATIONS.â€” A corpora- 
tion is unable to do anything beyond such powers as 
are granted it by law. As to the extent of the powers 
possessed by a corporation, we may conveniently di- 
vide corporate powers into those which are express 
and those which are implied. Express powers may be 
considered as including those which are mentioned in 
the official documents used or granted upon the be- 
ginning of the existence of the corporation. These 
official documents are spoken of as "charters" or "cer- 
tificates of incorporation." Whatever term may be 
applied to them there is generally in such documents 
a statement of the general purposes or objects for 
which the corporation is formed ; in other words, of the 
general business in which it is to engage. There is 
also a statement of the general powers of the corpora- 
tion which is to engage in the business mentioned. 
The powers so mentioned in such official documents 
may be termed, as we have stated, express powers 
of the corporation. Needless to say, however, it is 



198 COMMERCIAL LAW 

not usual or possible to attempt to indicate in any 
such official documents all the details of the opera- 
tions of business. Therefore, it is necessary to imply 
that in addition to such express powers the corpora- 
tion has power to do such acts as may be reasonably 
necessary or incidental to the carrying on of the busi- 
ness mentioned. Powers so implied, without words, 
are termed "implied powers." Therefore, the total 
powers of a corporation consist of the express powers, 
namely, such as are named in the official documents 
containing a statement of its purposes and the busi- 
ness in which it is to engage, and the powers which 
would be reasonably implied under the rule just men- 
tioned, as necessary and incidental to the carrying 
out of the express powers. Such implied powers do 
not give the corporation any power to do acts which 
are not reasonably necessary and incidental in its reg- 
ular business. To allow validity to acts not so rea- 
sonably necessary and incidental would be in reality 
allowing the corporation to engage in outside busi- 
ness, which, under its charter, it has no power to en- 
gage in. As an illustration of this let us assume 
that the X company was incorporated to build, run 
and operate a railroad between two towns named A 
and B. The official charter of the corporation may 
state further details of the corporation's powers or it 
may not. But, if such details are not stated, the cor- 
poration would, obviously, have as express powers, 
the power to build the road and to operate it between 
the towns mentioned. It would also have as implied 
powers the power to do any act reasonably necessary 



COMMERCIAL LAW 199 

or incidental to the operation of a railroad, such for 
example as the purchase of rails, ties or other railroad 
supplies, the hiring of employees, erection of stations 
and the power also to give negotiable paper in pay- 
ment for such supplies or the raising of money by 
mortgaging its property or otherwise where necessary 
to carry on its business. In other words, the corpora- 
tion may be said to have as implied powers all the 
powers which an individual would reasonably and 
usually exercise if he were operating the railroad. 
However, the corporation would have no power, ex- 
press or implied, to do any act not reasonably neces- 
sary to the railroad business, such, for example, as 
the purchase of a stock farm or the operation of a 
steamer line or a grocery store, or the leasing of its 
line. If the corporation, then, should make any con- 
tract with relation to engaging in these outside mat- 
ters â€” the corporation having no power to engage in 
them â€” a valid contract could not arise and therefore 
the corporation could not be held liable thereon. 

ULTRA VIRES ACTS.â€” Where a corporation 
attempts to do an act which is clearly beyond its ex- 
press or implied powers, such act is generally termed 
an "ultra vires" act, and it may frequently consist in 
an attempted contract by a corporation. Hence we 
must consider with some care contracts of corpora- 
tions which may be termed ultra vires. As the cor- 
poration lacks power it is generally said that the con- 
tract does not arise and hence neither the corpora- 
tion nor the person with whom it attempted to con- 
tract would theoretically be bound thereon. Yet, in 



200 COMMERCIAL LAW 

many States, a special rule has been adopted whereby 
a corporation may be held upon such contract in cer- 
tain cases even though it had no power to make it. 
This may be termed the "doctrine of estoppel," and 
generally includes cases where the corporation has 
assumed to make a contract which was ultra vires or 
beyond its powers but which would appear to an out- 
sider as incidental to the corporate business and there- 
fore as within its corporate powers. In such circum- 
stances, if the outsider with whom the corporation 
assumed to make the contract does in fact rely rea- 
sonably upon the corporate power to make it, having 
been deceived by appearances and having no warning 
that the corporation actually lacked power, and hav- 
ing paid over money or delivered goods or performed 
services or parted with other value under the contract, 
he may generally enforce the contract against the 
corporation. In other words, under such circum- 
stances, the corporation is estopped or forbidden to 
evade its obligation by asserting the point that it had 
no power to make such contract. However, this is 
strictly limited to cases where the corporation ap- 
peared to have the power to make the contract and 
where the person dealing with it had no reason to 
suspect or doubt its power in that regard, and where 
the person dealing with the corporation had parted 
with some value of the kind mentioned, in his reli- 
ance that the contract was within the corporate pow- 
ers of and therefore binding upon the corporation. 
Thus, where such person has done nothing toward 
carrying out his duty under the contract he would 



COMMERCIAL LAW 201 

have no claim or right to enforce the same as a bind- 
ing obligation of the corporation. Many courts also 
treat him somewhat differently and take the attitude 
that an outsider who has dealt with the corporation 
is entitled not to enforce the attempted contract, but 
is entitled only to recover from the corporation the 
reasonable value of such goods or service as it has 
voluntarily accepted from him. 

DE FACTO AND DE JURE CORPORA- 
TIONS. â€” It sometimes happens that a group of per- 
sons may attempt to organize a corporation and fail 
to comply with all the provisions of the law in the 
State in which they attempt to organize. The ques- 
tion arises then: What have we? Of course, we do 
not have a full completed organization, which we 
would call a corporation de jure (by right of law). 
We may have what is called a corporation de facto (in 
fact). In order to constitute a corporation de facto, it 
is generally held that the following requisites must ex- 
ist: There must be a valid law which authorizes the 
Formation of such a corporation ; a colorable attempt to 
organize under the provision of such law; and an as- 
sumption of corporate power, or, as is sometimes 
called, a user. If these facts exist, we then have a cor- 
poration de facto, and persons dealing with such a 
corporation are usually held to the same responsibili- 
ties as though it was an actual de jure corporation. 
The State, ordinarily, is the only person which can 
question the existence of such a body, and this is usu- 
ally done in a suit by the attorney-general. If the 
parties have not even complied with the requisites of 



202 COMMERCIAL LAW 

a de facto corporation, the authorities are divided as 
to what kind of an organization it is, although, per- 
haps, the best decisions would hold the parties liable 
as partners. They must have contemplated some 
kind of liability and failing to create even a corpora- 
tion de facto, a partnership liability is all that is left, 
except individual liability, and that is apparently just 
what they did not intend. 

PROMOTERS. â€” A promoter is a very common 
person in the modern industrial world. He is a person 
who brings about the organization of corporations, 
gets the people together who are interested in the en- 
terprise, aids in procuring subscriptions, and takes 
general charge of all the matters incident to the for- 
mation of the corporation. In other ways, he is gov- 
erned by the rules of agency and his position is that 
of a fiduciary. The majority of the courts hold that 
there is no liability on the part of the corporation to 
pay for his expenses and his services, in promoting 
the organization, unless the corporation as an organi- 
zation expressly promises to pay or otherwise clearly 
recognizes the obligation. Because of the fiduciary re- 
lationship, which a promoter occupies, he is not per- 
mitted to make any secret profits at the expense of the 
corporation. If he secures property for $1,000,000, he 
may not turn it over to the corporation for $1,500,000 
and pocket the profit himself. A corporation cannot 
be liable for the acts of a promoter before the corpora- 
tion came into existence. It may, however, after com* 
ing into existence adopt the acts of the promoter and 
thereby render itself liable. If, knowing the terms of 



COMMERCIAL LAW 203 

an agreement made by a promoter, the corporation 
takes advantage of the agreement or recognizes it, 
it thereby in effect itself becomes a party to the agree- 
ment. Unless the terms of a promoter's agreement 
expressly state the contrary, the promoter is person- 
ally liable upon it as a contractor. 

POWER OF THE STATE OVER A CORPO- 
RATION. â€” It must follow, that if a State creates a 
corporation, then it should have certain control over 
it. The United States Supreme Court has recognized 
the right of visitation as residing in the State. Visita- 
tion is, in law, the act of a superior or superintendent 
officer who visits a corporation to examine into its 
manner of conducting business and its observance of 
the laws. The visitation of National banks by the 
Comptroller of the Currency is a common example of 
the exercise of this authority. One of the most fam- 
ous cases in the United States Supreme Court is the 
Dartmouth College case. In 1769, the King of Eng- 
land granted a charter to twelve people under the 
name of "The Trustees of Dartmouth College." They 
were authorized to conduct a college and they founded 
Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. In 
1816, the legislature in the State of New Hampshire 
undertook to amend the charter in many ways, among 
other things, increasing the number of trustees to 
twenty-one. A furious conflict ensued between the 
State and the trustees. The State finally brought suit 
to recover the corporate seal and records which were 
held by a Mr. Woodward, who held them under the 
amendatory act to which we have referred. The case 



204 COMMERCIAL LAW 

is known as Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 
Wheaton 518. The Dartmouth College trustees were 
represented by Daniel Webster, and this is one of his 
famous cases before the Supreme Court. He took the 
position that the charter granted by the King of Eng- 
land and afterwards recognized by the State of New 
Hampshire, was a contract between the State and the 
trustees. This being so, it was protected by the pro- 
vision in the United States Constitution which pro- 
vides that no State shall pass any law impairing the 
obligation of contracts. The United States Supreme 
Court upheld this position. The act of the legislature 
of New Hampshire was held invalid. We then found 
ourselves in the position of having States creating 
corporations and then not being able to control them. 
Whatever may be said in regard to the law as laid 
down by the United States Supreme Court, this situa- 
tion was unfortunate. Shortly thereafter in the vari- 
ous State legislatures, a method to meet the situation 
was devised, and this is what was done: When a 
general corporation law is passed, the State inserts 
in it a clause to this effect: "The State hereby re- 
serves the right to alter, amend, or repeal the charter 
of any corporation organized under this act." This, 
then, makes this clause a part of the contract when a 
new corporation is organized. It knows that it is 
subject to having its charter amended or repealed 
without its consent. The effects, therefore, of the 
Dartmouth College decision have been practically 
nullified by such clauses inserted in the various incor- 
poration laws. Such incorporation acts do not relate 



COMMERCIAL LAW 205 

to corporations organized before such act was passed. 
Under this method of procedure, the legislature to- 
day surely has an efficacious method of controlling the 
corporations which it creates. 

LIABILITY FOR TORTS AND CRIMES.â€” -A 
corporation is ordinarily liable, the same as an indi- 
vidual, for all torts committed by its agents in the 
scope of their authority. A corporation may even be 
liable for acts which are beyond its authority. For ex- 
ample, in the case of Hannon v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 167 
N. Y. 244, it was held that the department store of the 
Siegel-Cooper Company, a corporation, was liable for 
mal-practice in dentistry. The charter of the company 
did not give the company the right to practice den- 
tistry, but space in the store was rented to a dentist 
who conducted a dental parlor. Because of his negli- 
gent treatment of a patient, the court held that the 
corporation was liable for the negligent acts of its 
agent. Corporations may also be held liable for such 
torts as involve a mental element, like fraud and libel. 
A corporation may be criminally responsible for fail- 
ure to perform a duty imposed upon it by law, and in 
many States there are statutes which make it a crimi- 
nal offense for a corporation to do or fail to do certain 
acts. It is generally held, however, that a corporation 
cannot commit a crime which involves a mental op- 
eration, as for example, murder. Murder involves a 
mental operation; it is "killing with malice afore- 
thought." Then again, it would be difficult to punish 
a corporation for the crime of murder, because under 
our State constitutions, the punishment for murder 



206 COMMERCIAL LAW 

is either death or life imprisonment. Although a cor- 
poration is a separate person, there is no way to kill 
it or imprison it for life. You surely would not do so 
by inflicting this penalty on all the stockholders. It is 
generally provided, then, by statute that such crimes 
that a corporation can commit are to be punished 
either by a fine or by imprisonment of the directors. 

SHERMAN ANTI-TRUST ACT.â€” On July 2, 
1890, the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was passed by Con- 
gress. The first section of this act reads : "Every con- 
tract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby 
declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make 
any such contract, or engage in any such combination 
or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misde- 
meanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished 
by a fine not exceeding $5,000, or by imprisonment not 
exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, 
in the discretion of the court." The second section of 
this act reads : ''Every person who shall monopolize, 
or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with 
any other person or persons to monopolize any part 
of the trade or commerce among the several states, 
or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be pun- 
ished by a fine not exceeding $5,000, or by imprison- 
ment not exceeding one year, or by both said punish- 
ments, in the discretion of the court." 

It would be impossible, in a small amount of 
space, to call attention, except in sL general way, to 



COMMERCIAL LAW 207 

the importance of this act and the difficulty of under- 
standing it, without carefully reading the various con- 
flicting decisions of the United States Supreme Court 
handed down since the passage of the act. The act, 
being a Federal act, relates only to interstate com- 
merce. That kind of business, conducted by corpora- 
tions, which is intrastate, if controlled at all by similar 
legislation, would be by virtue of a State act. Per- 
haps the most famous of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act 
cases decided by the United States Supreme Court is 
that of the United States v. Standard Oil Co., 221 U. 
S. 1, where the majority opinion was written by the 
late Chief Justice White, and in which he enunciated 
the so-called "rule of reason" which brings the inter- 
pretation of that act very much in harmony with the 
rules of the common law in regard to illegal contracts 
and monopolies. 

BY-LAWS. â€” A by-law is a permanent rule for 
the government of a corporation and its officers. The 
purpose of a by-law is to regulate and define the duties 
of the members of the corporation toward the cor- 
poration and between themselves. The power to 
make the by-laws is vested in the stockholders. There 
are certain qualifications which all by-laws must pos- 
sess. They must be reasonable and not inconsistent 
with law or any rule of public policy. It would not 
be possible for a majority of the stockholders at a 
regular stockholders' meeting to pass by-laws which 
would deliberately deprive the minority stockholders 
of rights which belong to them. The by-laws are, of 
course, always subject to the provisions of the charter 



208 COMMERCIAL LAW 

of the corporation, and if a corporation is authorized 
to operate a railroad, it could not, by passing a by-law, 
to the effect that it was deemed wise to enter into the 
steel manufacturing business, change the nature of 
the corporation in that manner. 

STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING.â€” In order that 
the acts of the majority of stockholders shall be valid, 
they must be authorized at a regular stockholders* 
meeting. This must be held in the principal office of 
the company, and the notice required by the by-laws 
must be given to all of the stockholders. After this 
is done, the majority of the stockholders may trans- 
act business and bind the corporation. Of course, in 
a large corporation with a hundred thousand share- 
holders, as is the case with some of our bigger corpo- 
rations like the United States Steel Corporation and 
the Pennsylvania Railroad, very few of the stockhold- 
ers actually attend the meetings. The directors usually 
send out with the notice of the meeting, a proxy, and 
the stockholders who are not able to be present send 
in their proxy authorizing certain persons to vote for 
them. In this way, a majority of the stockholders are 
present at the meeting, either in person or by proxy. 
In certain cases stockholders may interfere with the 
action of directors in connection with the general man- 
agement of a corporation, or may even oust the di- 
rectors from their positions. These cases are ex- 
tremely rare, since the power of directors is supreme 
as to all corporate matters as to which the statutes or 
by-laws do not provide for concurrence or other action 
by the stockholders. Where proof is offered, how- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 209 

ever, of fraud, violation of law or gross negligence 
of the directors whereby loss has been caused or is 
threatened, stockholders may in some cases obtain the 
ousting of directors. This sometimes results in plac- 
ing a receiver in temporary charge of the corporation 
or in the holding of a special election of new directors. 
No complaint, however, will generally be entertained 
against directors merely because their judgment does 
not agree with that of the stockholders even if some 
action of the directors may not have resulted favor- 
ably to the corporation, provided such action was 
taken honestly and with all due care and regard to 
law. As an illustration, the directors of the X Com- 
pany made a certain contract on behalf of the cor- 
poration whereby it was agreed with Y that property 
of the corporation should be transferred to the latter 
for much less than its evident actual value. This 
operation would usually indicate fraud on the part of 
the directors, or at least such gross negligence as 
would in many cases justify stockholders in asking a 
legal inquiry into the action of the directors, which 
would result, if sufficient facts were proved, in their 
removal and an injunction against the performance 
of the contract. However, if the value of the prop- 
erty were doubtful and the directors had used all due 
care and effort to ascertain its true value and to obtain 
the best available price, no complaint could usually 
be made although it should later develop that a better 
price might have been obtained. 

FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.â€” A foreign cor- 
poration is one which is organized under the laws of 



210 COMMERCIAL LAW 

some foreign country or some other State. Foreign 
corporations are not necessarily confined to doing 
business in their own State ; they may enter other 
States. As for example, a company organized in New 
Jersey may enter the State of New York and do busi- 
ness. If, however, the New Jersey corporation comes 
to New York and makes a regular practice of doing 
business, it must comply with the provisions of the 
corporation law of New York, and secure a license to 
do business in New York. It is not uncommon to en- 
force this provision in an indirect method by provid- 
ing that if a foreign corporation does not take out 
this license, it shall not be allov/ed to sue in the courts 
of the State where it is doing business. 

MANAGEMENT OF CORPORATIONS.â€” 
The management of any corporation rests directly 
with the board of directors and they may be consid- 
ered as the agents of the corporation to direct its busi- 
ness affairs. The directors, however, are subject in 
their action to any limitation upon their power which 
may have been included in the charter or certificate 
of incorporation or which may have been adopted in 
the by-laws. The directors are also subject to any 
provisions in the statutes of the State, which fre- 
quently provide that they shall not take certain im- 
portant actions, such as the mortgaging of corporate 
property, etc., without special procedure involving a 
meeting and vote of the stockholders. Where, how- 
ever, the directors' authority is not limited by the 
statutes or the charter or by-laws, they may be con- 
sidered as having full power to manage the affairs 



COMMERCIAL LAW 211 

of the corporation. In connection with that power 
they may elect a president and other corporate officers 
and may appoint any other agents or employees at 
their discretion. They may also define the powers to 
be exercised by the president and, the other officers 
and employees. This would give them power to limit 
the authority of the president or any other officer. 
Hov/ever, where a person deals with the president or 
any other officer of a corporation in behalf of the cor- 
poration, he may usually rely reasonably upon the 
president or other officer having similar power to that 
generally possessed by such an officer, and in many 
cases the corporation would be held bound by the acts 
of such officer even though he actually violated some 
limits placed upon him by the directors. This may 
be illustrated by assuming that the X Company was 
in the business of manufacturing furniture, and A, 
the president thereof, had made a contract with B, 
an outsider, for the purchase from the latter of cer- 
tain wood to be used in the corporate business. As a 
matter of fact, however. A, the president, had no 
power to make such contract, since the directors had 
passed a resolution forbidding him to purchase any 
raw materials without first having the proposed pur- 
chase approved by the board of directors. Therefore, 
A, as a matter of fact, would have no power to make 
the contract with B, on behalf of the corporation. Yet, 
B had not in any way been warned of this limitation 
upon A's power, and as the purchase of materials 
would be a usual one; for the president or executive 
head of such a corporation to make, B might reason- 



212 COMMERCIAL LAW 

ably assume that A had power to make the contract. 
Therefore, B would be able to hold the corporation 
to the contract under the principle of apparent au- 
thority, considered in connection with the law of 
agency. Naturally, in turn, the directors would have 
a claim against the president for any loss sustained, 
as he had not only violated his duty but had also dis- 
obeyed and disregarded explicit instructions. The 
by-laws of a corporation are generally adopted by the 
stockholders and provide for all matters relating to 
the corporate management which are not provided 
for in the charter or certificate of incorporation. Such 
by-laws are binding upon all persons who know of 
them, or reasonably should know of them, provided 
they are not in violation of law and are reasonable. 
It is the general rule that meetings called to adopt 
new by-laws or to alter previous by-laws should be 
announced in some special way so that all interested 
parties may receive due notice and thus have an op- 
portunity to arrange to be present and vote on the 
matters to be taken up at such meeting. 

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS.â€” The directors 
of a corporation are elected by the stockholders and 
the election generally takes place at the regular an- 
nual meeting of stockholders of the corporation. 
Either the entire board of directors is elected at that 
time for the ensuing year, or a portion of them. In 
this connection it is provided by the statutes of many 
States that at least a certain proportion of the total 
number of directors shall be elected annually. The 
method of electing such directors at the annual meet- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 213 

ing is usually provided for by the statutes of the vari- 
ous States, but it is commonly the rule that each stock- 
holder shall have one vote for each share of stock 
owned by him, although in some States they also al- 
low what is termed "cumulative voting." This 
method of voting generally allows each stockholder to 
have as many votes as he owns shares of stock multi- 
plied by the number of directors to be elected at the 
meeting and he may cast all of his votes for one or 
more of the candidates. In other words if five di- 
rectors are to be elected he may concentrate all his 
votes upon one or more of the candidates and is not 
compelled to vote for each one. This cumulative vot- 
ing is authorized for the purpose of allowing the 
minority stockholders to concentrate their votes upon 
one or two of the candidates and thus have some rep- 
resentation upon the board of directors. As an il- 
lustration of this, let us assume that the X Company 
had an authorized capital stock of $100,000, composed 
of 1,000 shares at the par value of $100 per share, and 
that all these 1,000 shares are issued and fully paid 
up. Let us further assume that six individuals each 
own 100 shares of stock and; act in unison, thereby 
constituting a majority, the other 400 shares of stock 
being held by the minority stockholders. Each stock- 
holder would usually have one vote for each share of 
stock owned by him, and therefore, if five directors 
were to be elected under the usual method of voting, 
those individuals composing the majority of the stock- 
holders would succeed in casting a majority of votes 
for each of the five directors. This would leave the 



214 COMMERCIAL LAW 

minority without representation upon the board. If, 
however, cumulative voting were used, the minority 
having a total of 2,000 votes (400 multiplied by 5, 
the number of directors to be elected) could concen- 
trate 2,000 votes upon one or two of their candidates 
and this would probably insure the election of such 
candidates to the board, thus giving the minority rep- 
resentation. In the case of a non-stock or member- 
ship corporation, each member has simply one vote 
for directors or for other purposes. It may be noted 
that the directors themselves, in their meetings, have 
also one vote each and this is entirely independent of 
the amount of stock which they may own in the cor- 
poration. It should also be noted that the directors in 
their meetings may not vote by proxy, but sometimes 
the members of a membership corporation may vote 
in this way. Voting by proxy is a usual practice in 
stock corporations. A proxy is merely a power of at- 
torney or agency given in writing by one stockholder 
whereby he authorizes another person as his proxy 
to vote, at a corporate meeting, his shares of stock 
in his place. A proxy should be in writing and in a 
form in accordance with the statutes of the State in- 
volved, and is often, but not necessarily, under seal. 
A stockholder who has given a proxy may revoke it 
whenever he chooses and this would prevent the 
holder of the proxy from voting on it. This would 
be entirely independent of whether the person giving 
the proxy had by revoking it violated his contract 
with the person to whom it was given. That contract 
would be only a private matter between them. 



COMMERCIAL LAW . 215 

VOTING TRUSTS.â€” The proxy principle is in- 
volved in what are termed "voting trusts." These ar- 
rangements involve the placing by a number of stock- 
holders of their stock in the hands of certain persons, 
giving to the latter the right to vote on the stock ; in 
other words, it is a concentration of the stock of a 
number of persons in the hands of one or a few per- 
sons. The latter are termed "voting trustees." It is 
necessary to consult the statutes of the various States 
with regard to the legality of such voting trusts, but 
they are generally permitted, with the restriction, 
however, that the agreement under which the stock is 
deposited with the voting trustee or trustees must be 
in writing and that any stockholder may have the 
right to deposit his stock with such trustee or trus- 
tees and become a party to the voting trust. The 
statutes also frequently limit the time during which 
such a voting trust may continue. 

ISSUE OF STOCK.â€” The stock of a corpora- 
tiorH is in theory issued for an amount of money or 
property equal to the par value of the stock. In prac- 
tice, however, in many States there is no limitation 
on the valuation which the promoters of a corpora- 
tion may put upon the property or rights which are 
transferred to the corporation. The stock is regarded 
as fully paid in if property transferred to it is trans- 
ferred as having the assumed value of the corpora- 
tion's capital, however little the property may actually 
be worth. In other States, however, an official must ap- 
prove the valuation put upon property transferred 
as payment for stock, and in such States it may be 



216 COMMERCIAL LAW 

assumed that the assets of a corporation when it be- 
gins business represent at least approximately the 
amount of its capital stock ; even in such States, how- 
ever, there is no difficulty in promoting a corporation 
which shall have a large capital though its property 
is of slight value. All that is necessary is to incor- 
porate under the laws of another State which allows 
greater freedom. Corporations organized in one 
State are in general allowed to do business in other 
States; so that a corporation which is intended to 
carry on business in New York, may be incorporated 
in another State, where it is not expected to do busi- 
ness. 

PROCEDURE IN ISSUING BONDS.â€” It is 
sometimes difficult for the investor fully to appreciate 
the vast amount of detail work involved in the bring- 
ing out of a new bond issue. Before the investment 
banker underwrites the issue, or makes his purchase 
from the corporation â€” before the bonds are offered to 
the public â€” there is always a painstaking and minute 
investigation of the new security from many different 
viewpoints, made by and in behalf of the banker. The 
investor can never know from the banker's printed 
circular, descriptive of the issue, the great amount of 
original work which underlies it and of which it is a 
meager reflection. The circular is a summary of the 
banker's investigation ; it contains the salient features 
of the issue and of the issuing corporation, reduced 
to terms that are intelligible to the average layman. 
It Is a statement of the principal facts which led 
the banker to make an investigation of the busi- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 217 

ness and upon which investigation he bases his 
recommendation of the security offered by him to his 
clients. 

WHAT IS A BOND?â€” This can be explained 
best by comparing it with a real estate bond and mort- 
gage, the nature of which has already been discussed. 
When money is loaned on real estate, the mortgagor, 
or the one who borrows, executes two papers in favor 
of the mortgagee, or the lender. The first is either a 
promissory note or a bond. The bond is a sealed writ- 
ing whereby the borrower binds himself, his heirs, ad- 
ministrators or executors, or assigns, to pay the lender 
a given sum of money at a specified time, together 
with interest. The second paper given as security for 
the note or bond, is a mortgage, which conveys the 
title to the property to the lender, with the provision, 
however, that if the borrower satisfies the conditions 
imposed in the bond â€” that is, the payment of a certain 
sum of money at a given time, together with interest 
as agreed â€” this conveyance (mortgage) is to be held 
null and void. 

WHAT IS A CORPORATION INDENTURE? 
â€” The indenture is a more lengthy instrument than 
the bond, and, as will be noted, it is called an "in- 
denture" and not a "mortgage." The mortgage 
strictly is only that portion of the indenture whereby 
the property is conveyed or deeded to the mortgagee, 
with the provision that the deed so given is to be held 
null and void in the event that the conditions named 
in the bond are faithfully carried out. The indenture 
is broader than the mortgage; it contains provisions 



218 COMMERCIAL LAW 

other than those bearing directly on the mortgage. 
An indenture is a sealed agreement between two or 
more parties and any number of provisions may be 
inserted in it, in addition to the mortgage clauses, as 
may be deemed necessary or desirable. It is always 
possible for the individual to obtain a loan secured by 
a lien on his property, provided the security is good 
and considered ample. If, however, his property was 
of so great value that he desired to obtain a loan of 
several millions of dollars, he would find it difficult, 
or even impossible, to find any one person willing to 
lend him so large an amount. If, however, the bor- 
rower could find a number of persons who could and 
would jointly contribute enough money to equal the 
amount of the loan, he could divide this total amount 
into equal parts and each lender could have such a 
proportionate interest as might be desired. This, then, 
is the case with large corporations, which are legal- 
ized persons. Owing to the fact that the holders of 
the bonds have only a fractional interest in the loan 
and therefore in any property that may be pledged to 
secure it, it is impossible to create separate mortgages 
in favor of the individual bondholders on any particu- 
lar part of the property. No portion of the property 
can be specifically designated â€” the interests of the 
bondholders are in common. For this reason and 
others, corporations are obliged to create what is 
known as a Mortgage Deed of Trust â€” making the 
mortgage to secure the many bonds in favor of some 
responsible individual or trust company, who holds 
it on behalf of the various bondholders in accordance 



COMMERCIAL LAW 219 

with the definite terms of the trust, and who is there- 
fore known as the Trustee. The indenture of the cor- 
poration must in addition to covering the mortgage, 
contain other related and necessary covenants, especi- 
ally as to the trust that must be created. As there 
are so many covenants or provisions necessary in 
order to fully protect all interests concerned, the cor- 
poration indenture becomes bulky, but its form in 
substance is not very different from that of the bond 
and mortgage of the individual, which we have al- 
ready analyzed, and which for this reason it is well 
for us to keep in mind as we follow the corporation 
indenture. 

ANALYSIS OF INDENTURES.â€” The inden- 
ture, or agreement, must of necessity be made between 
certain parties, the mortgagor or the corporation and 
the mortgagee, in this case the Trustee who holds the 
security given in trust for the various bondholders. 
It is, therefore, proper that we recite at the very be- 
ginning of the indenture the parties in interest, giving 
their legal residence, or as in the case of corporations 
the names of the States wherein they are incorpo- 
rated. It isiquite essential that we know in what State 
a corporation was incorporated, as its rights and priv- 
ileges are determined by the statutes of the State 
which created it and by the charter which has been 
granted to it. What are our reasons for creating the 
indenture? The very first premise is that the cor- 
poration is legally able to borrow money by law. If 
it did not have this right we could proceed no further. 
To borrow money and mortgage or pledge property 



220 COMMERCIAL LAW 

as security therefor is a common law right of corpora- 
tions, but the amount which may be borrowed is 
sometimes limited by State statutes. In the event 
that the corporation desired to borrow in excess of the 
limitation, additional capital stock is sometimes au- 
thorized thereby creating a larger basis for borrow- 
ing. If this premise is not incorporated, its omission 
does not affect the status of the indenture, but it is 
generally placed, as many other premises are, in the 
indenture, for the sake of logic, and to show that the 
matter has been considered, and that the fact is ad- 
mitted by the parties to the indenture. The purpose 
for which the bonds are to be issued is sometimes duly 
set forth, as for instance, to refund certain maturing 
obligations, to construct a certain extension, to build 
new terminals, etc. While the purpose may not al- 
ways be mentioned in the indenture, nevertheless it 
must accord with the charter of the corporation and 
the laws of the State. The company cannot exceed 
the powers that have been granted to it. We next 
want to know whether the authority to borrow money 
and issue bonds therefor has been obtained in lawful 
manner. Provisions covering the manner of securing 
this authority will be found in the by-laws of the cor- 
poration, and the counsel must examine this matter 
carefully in order to see whether all legal formalities 
have been strictly observed and whether the resolu- 
tions are in proper order. There are certain essential 
facts that must be stated in the bonds themselves and 
which are elaborated in the covenants of the inden- 
ture. These facts are embodied in the resolutions of 



COMMERCIAL LAW 221 

the Board of Directors and of the stockholders and 
are, therefore, incorporated in the premises of the 
indenture. These facts include the total amount of 
bonds authorized, title, denomination, form, date of 
issue and maturity, rate of interest and where payable. 
In order that there may be uniformity in the wording 
and form of the bonds, so that no one holder will per- 
chance receive an undue advantage over any other 
bondholder, the form of the bond, its coupons and 
trustee's certificate must be duly set forth in the in- 
denture. 

LIMITATION OF POWERS OF DIREC- 
TORS. â€” There are various matters wherein directors 
of any corporation do not usually have power to act 
on behalf of the corporation without special authoriza- 
tion. Such matters include the amendment of the 
corporate charter (thereby changing the purposes of 
the corporation), the change of the name of the cor- 
poration, the increase or decrease of authorized capi- 
tal stock, the sale of the total corporate assets and 
franchise, the consolidation of the corporation where 
permitted by statute, and the giving of mortgages 
upon the corporate property. This last point is espe- 
cially important since the validity of a corporate 
mortgage as security for a loan of money depends 
upon whether the mortgage was authorized and given 
in all respects pursuant to statute of the State in- 
volved. As these corporate mortgages not only are 
given as security for a single loan of money but also 
furnish security often for very large amounts of bonds, 
the matter of the authority of the directors and the 



222 COMMERCIAL LAW 

validity of the mortgage becomes of great importance. 
Therefore the statutes of the State involved must be 
followed closely as to the procedure in connection 
with the giving of a mortgage. It may be stated, how- 
ever, with regard to this matter and the other special 
matters mentioned, the statutes generally provide 
that some form of authorization should be obtained 
from the stockholders, generally through their vote at 
a special meeting called for that purpose, of which 
proper notification and announcement have been 
given ; that some form of certificate as to the proceed- 
ings at such meeting be made and filed by the secre- 
tary and treasurer or other designated officer of the 
corporation; that it should also be filed in the office 
of the county clerk of the county involved and in the 
office of the Secretary of State; and that some noti- 
fication of the act in question be also given to the 
directors as well as the stockholders. It is, of course, 
impossible to take up the details as to such matters, 
the only safe course to pursue being to follow with 
extreme care the statutes of the State wherein such 
action is to be taken. From the foregoing, however, 
the general purpose and effect of prevailing law may 
be seen. 

DIVIDENDS ON STOCK.â€” Dividends on the 
stock of corporations are declared by the directors, 
v\7ho have power to use their discretion as to the 
amount to be disbursed in this way. The statutes 
are, however, very explicit in prohibiting the declara- 
tion of any dividends except out of the surplus profits 
of the business conducted by the corporation. With 



COMMERCIAL LAW 223 

respect to dividends properly declared, the declaration 
of the directors generally provides that they shall be 
paid to all stockholders registered upon the books of 
the company at a specified date in the future. Hence, 
if a stockholder should sell or otherwise transfer his 
stock, after that date to another person, the latter, 
v^hile becoming the owner of the stock, would not be 
entitled to the dividend when paid. It would be pay- 
able to the former stockholder, although he might, 
pursuant to the agreement made with the person to 
whom he sold the stock, turn over to the latter the 
amount of the dividend. 

CUMULATIVE DIVIDENDS.â€” It frequently 
happens that a corporation does not earn any divi- 
dends in a particular year. The question arises, is the 
holder of a 7% preferred stock in a position to de- 
mand that the dividend be paid the following year. 
Suppose the corporation earns nothing in 1921 and 
earns 14% in 1922. The holder of one share of a 
non-cumulative preferred stock would receive the 
usual 7% dividend only in 1922. If the stock were 
cumulative he would receive 14%. In other words 
the unearned dividends accumulate and become a 
charge which the corporation must pay when suffi- 
cient is earned in prosperous years before the holders 
of common stock are entitled to receive any dividend. 
Usually the stock certificate and the articles of incor- 
poration specify whether stock is cumulative or non- 
cumulative. If they do not, then reference to the law 
of the State where the company is incorporated, is 
necessary to decide such a question. 



224 COMMERCIAL LAW 

LIABILITY OF OFFICERS AND DIREC- 
TORS TO THE CORPORATION.â€” Whether a cor- 
poration becomes liable by virtue of action taken by 
its officers or directors depends upon principles of 
agency applied to the law of corporations. These 
principles have already been stated. Whether the 
directors or officers are themselves personally liable 
is another matter. Conceivably they may be liable 
either to their employer (the corporation) or to credi- 
tors of the corporation. They are not directly liable 
to the shareholders as such. Any injury or v/rong 
they may indirectly do to shareholders is directly done 
to the corporation, the shareholders being injured 
only because the corporation in which he is interested 
is injured. Shareholders may, however, institute pro- 
ceedings against directors or officers if, as not infre- 
quently happens, the corporation itself, being con- 
trolled by the wrongdoers, fails to take proceedings. 
The shareholders in such a case, however, demand re- 
dress for the corporation, not for themselves; and 
whatever may be recovered, is recovered for the bene- 
fit of the corporation. The duty of the directors and 
officers of the corporation is analogous to the duty of 
any agent to his principal. That is, each officer or 
director must exercise reasonable diligence in the per- 
formance of his work and must observe fidelity to his 
principal. The application of these principles to par- 
ticular fact is not always easy, but the principles 
themselves are plain. Especially the degree of care 
which directors are bound to use presents a trouble- 
some question of fact. In a small business it may be 



COMMERCIAL LAW 225 

the duty of a director to take active control of the 
policy of the company and supervise with some min- 
uteness each business operation. Such direction is 
impossible where a great railroad or industrial cor- 
poration is concerned. In such a case directors neces- 
sarily derive their information from subordinate 
agents and cannot investigate facts for themselves. 
Directors are not liable for mistakes of judgment if 
they use reasonable care; if, however, they wilfully 
do an act which they know is not authorized by the 
charter or by-laws of the corporation, they will be 
liable for the consequences. Directors who are cogni- 
zant of wrongs committed by their co-directors and 
fail to take available measures to prevent the wrongs, 
become liable themselves. Directors may terminate 
their liability for future acts by resigning, but resig- 
nation will not destroy liability for acts already done 
even though the resulting damage does not happen 
until after resignation. The corporation requires that 
a director or other officer shall not act on behalf of 
the corporation in a matter in which he has a per- 
sonal interest at variance with that of the corporation. 
Should matters of this sort arise, as they often do, 
the interested officer or director should not take part 
in the decision of the question, and may render him- 
self liable if he does so. 

LIABILITY OF OFFICERS TO CREDI- 
TORS. â€” So long as a corporation is solvent, credi- 
tors of the corporation have no reason or right to seek 
redress from any one but the corporation itself. Credi- 
tors of an insolvent corporation, however, may enjoin 



226 COMMERCIAL LAW 

action by the company's officers which is unauthorized 
or likely to prove detrimental to the assets of the cor- 
poration. If the officers knowingly misapply the as- 
sets of an insolvent corporation they are personally 
liable to the creditors for the injury caused thereby. 
They are liable sometimes by) statute, but also even 
apart from statute, for false statements of the condi- 
tion of the corporation in reliance upon which credit 
is given the corporation. Like other agents, the offi- 
cers of a corporation impliedly warrant to persons 
with whom they deal their authority to do the acts 
which they undertake; and if authority is lacking, they 
are liable personally. The only qualification of this 
principle is that if the facts from which authority, or 
lack of it, may be determined, are known to the person 
dealing with them, they are not liable; that is, they 
do not warrant the correctness of an inference of au- 
thority from known facts. 

LIABILITY OF BANK OFFICERS. -- The 
principles governing the liability of bank directors and 
other officers of a bank are the same as those which 
govern similar questions regarding other corpora- 
tions. The bank laws, however, impose certain duties 
and penalties which affect the application of general 
principles. It may be worth while to enumerate 
briefly some of the duties of different bank officers, 
a violation of which renders them personally liable. 
As to directors it has been said that *'It is not neces- 
sary to show directly that the directors actually had 
their attention called to the mismanagement of the 
affairs of the bank, or to the misconduct of subordi- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 227 

nate officers. It is sufficient to show that the evidence 
of the management or misconduct were such that it 
must have been brought to their knowledge unless 
they were grossly negligent or wilfully careless in 
the discharge of their duties." They are liable for 
the consequences not only of their own fraud but of 
their ultra vires acts. They are liable for approving 
the discount of notes known to be worthless or of 
so doubtful value as to be obviously unsafe. If guilty 
of negligence in failing to discover that such paper 
was worthless they may also be liable. They are 
guilty of negligence and may thereby render them- 
selves liable if they wholly neglect to ascertain the 
condition of the bank from its books, though a thor- 
ough examination of the books of a bank, especially 
of one transacting a large business, cannot be ex- 
pected of every director; and the law would require 
no more than would be demanded by the standard of 
reasonableness. 

THE PRESIDENT.â€” The duties of the presi- 
dent, and consequently his liabilities, must be de- 
termined by general law, the charter of the particu- 
lar institution, its by-laws, and by general business 
usage. Thus, if the usage exists for the president to 
draw and sign checks in the absence of the cashier, 
the president will have authority so to act. He has 
authority to conduct the litigation of the bank; he 
may employ counsel. He may generally indorse ne- 
gotiable paper of the bank. On the other hand, he 
will be personally liable if he permits improper loans 
or over-drafts; if he fails to give proper instructions 



228 COMMERCIAL LAW 

to inferior officers; if it is his duty to require a bond 
from an inferior officer, and he fails to do so; and, 
generally, if he commits a breach of duty to the cor- 
poration which causes damage. He has no power 
to execute deeds of real estate without authority of 
the directors and, generally, an instrument which 
must be executed under the seal of the bank must be 
authorized by the board. The discount of negotiable 
paper also is a duty of the directors. 

THE CASHIER.â€” The Supreme Court of Maine 
has thus expressed the functions of the cashier of a 
bank : "A cashier, it is well known, is allowed to pre- 
sent himself to the public as habitually accustomed 
to make pajmient for its bills or notes payable to 
other persons; to make payment for bills and notes 
discounted by the directors; to receive payment for 
bills of exchange, notes, and other debts due to the 
bank; to receive money on deposit and to pay the 
same to the order of the depositors. He is presented 
as having the custody of its books, bills of exchange, 
notes, and other evidences of debt due to it, and, in- 
deed, of all its movable property; as making entry 
in its books and as keeping its accounts and a record 
of its proceedings. In many banks these duties are 
performed in part by tellers, clerks, or assistants, but 
generally, it is believed, under his superintendence, 
and he might at any time assume the performance of 
them and perform them, if able to do so, without such 
assistance. His true position appears to be that of a 
general agent for the performance of his official and 
accustomed duties. While acting within the scope 



COMMERCIAL LAW 229 

of this authority he would bind the bank, although he 
might violate his private instructions." He must ex- 
ercise proper oversight over subordinate officers; he 
must use reasonable care and skill. He may become 
liable personally for failure to observe instructions 
as to a special deposit; for the improper sale of stock 
held as security for a loan; for improperly making 
loans, for failure to give essential information to the 
directors; for failing to exercise proper oversight 
over inferior officers or agents, as well as in the more 
obvious case where he has taken advantage of his 
position to commit intentional fraud upon the bank. 
BLUE SKY LAWS.â€” The term "blue sky" has 
become very familiar to the corporation lawyer in the 
last few years. The so-called "blue sky" legislation is 
a well meaning, if partly futile, attempt to meet an ex- 
isting evil in connection with the sale of corporate 
securities. We shall find later that five elements are 
necessary to constitute the action of fraud or deceit: 
(1) a false representation of a material fact; (2) made 
with knowledge of its falsity; (3) with intent that it 
be acted upon; (4) that it be acted upon; (5) damage 
follows. The courts have almost universally held that 
a mere statement of opinion does not give rise to a 
cause of action for fraud, whereas a mistatement of 
fact does. Hence if I state to you when selling you 
100 shares of the Bonanza Gold Mining Corporation 
that the company has never paid less than 20 7o in 
dividends during the last five years and you purchase 
the stock relying on this misrepresentation of fact (the 
situation actually being the company has never paid a 



230 COMMERCIAL LAW 

dividend) you would have a cause of action in deceit 
against me. If, however, I had simply said in selling 
you the stock that the outlook for the company was 
the brightest in its history, that the president had told 
me that dividends of 30% a year were assured indef- 
initely and that this stock was by far the best bargain 
which had been on the market in over a year, although 
I know when I made such statements that there was 
little or nothing to substantiate them, nevertheless, I 
would not be liable in deceit. My statements were 
merely matters of opinion or what we call "seller's 
talk" or "puffing one's wares." 

THE FINANCIAL PROSPECTUS.â€”If you 
will examine the average financial prospectus of a new 
stock being offered for sale to the public, you will find 
that when most of the high sounding terms and flat- 
tering statements are analyzed carefully that they 
will fall in this second class of non-actionable state- 
ments. There are few statements of fact but many 
glowing statements in the nature of "seller's talk." 
We all know, however, that enormous quantities of 
worthless stock are sold each year by this method. 
When business conditions are good it sometimes 
seems as if the wilder the scheme the easier it is to 
find a gullible public ready to purchase such securi- 
ties. To prevent the perpetration of such frauds on 
the public is the object of the so-called "blue sky" 
legislation. 

THE LAW ANALYZED.â€” The first "blue sky" 
law was passed in Kansas in 1911. The evil sought to 
be remedied was so prevalent that the idea spread rap- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 231 

idly and now similar legislation, of one type or an- 
other, has been enacted in a majority of the States. 
Some of the acts are crude, some have been held un- 
constitutional, and many are difficult of enforcement. 
Recently, however, more care has been taken in draft- 
ing such legislation, and many of the earlier laws will 
undoubtedly be amended to conform with this later 
legislation. We may take the Illinois statute of 1919 
as a good sample of a drastic yet fairly workable Act. 
The law may be briefly considered from three stand- 
points: (1) the persons affected; (2) the securities 
affected; (3) the penalties provided for violation of 
its provisions. 

AS TO THE PERSONS AFFECTED.â€” Gen- 
erally any person offering any securities, and any sel- 
ler's agent or broker, the issuer, or any agent or direc- 
tor of the issuer, or any owner or dealer, is covered by 
the Act. Illinois fiscal corporations such as banks, 
trust companies, insurance companies, building and 
loan associations and the like are practically exempt 
from the provisions of the Illinois securities law. 

THE ILLINOIS ACT.â€” The Illinois act covers 
the following securities : 

Section 3. For the purposes of this Act securities 
are divided into four classes as follows : 

(1) Securities, the inherent qualities of which 
assure their sale and disposition without the perpe-

or sold ; 

(2) Stating the law under which and the time

curities in Class "C." 

Such statement shall be verified by the oath of 
not less than two credible persons having knowledge 
of the facts. Not less than twenty-five copies of such 
statement, wholly printed or wholly typewritten, shall 
at the time of filing the original statement be filed 
with the Secretary of State. The printed or type- 
written copies so filed shall bear at the top in bold 
faced type the expression : 

"Securities in Class *C* under Illinois Securities 
Law," followed by the expression, also in bold-faced 
type: 

"This statement is prepared by parties interested 
in the sale of securities herein mentioned. Neither 
the State of Illinois, nor any officer of the State, as- 
sumes any responsibility for any statement contained 
herein nor recommends any of the securities described

Section 9 gives the requisites of the statement 
required to be filed with the Secretary of State before 
securities of Class "D" may be sold. Such statement 
is even more complete than that required in Section 7. 

SALES AND CONTRACTS VOID. â€” Every 
sale or contract in violation of the act is void, and the 
fines vary from not less than $100 to not more than 
$25,000, and the imprisonment from six months to 
five years. Although there is great need for a Federal 
incorporation act there is even greater need for a Fed- 
eral blue sky law. With different acts in the differ- 
ent States, the Illinois act being simply an example, 
even the most careful business man may unwittingly 
find himself in a position where he has violated one of 
these laws with their severe penalties. 



CHAPTER VII 



Transfer of Stock 

UNIFORM TRANSFER OF STOCK.â€” Turn 
now to an entirely different matter, the trans- 
fer of stock. A stock certificate is one of the 
quasi-negotiable instruments of commerce, at com- 
mon law not fully negotiable like bills and notes, but, 
nevertheless, having some of the attributes of nego- 
tiability, especially in States where what is called the 
Uniform Transfer of Stock Act has been enacted. 
This statute applies only to corporations of those 
States which have passed the statute. 

TWO METHODS OF TRANSFERRING 
STOCK. â€” Stock may be transferred in two ways: 
first, by delivery of the certificate with the indorse- 
ment upon it of the owner of the stock, indicating 
that he assigns or authorizes the assignment of the 
stock, and second, by delivery of the certificate, with 
a separate document of assignment attached stating 
that the owner of the certificate assigns or author- 
izes the transfer of the stock. This second method 
is not so completely good as the first, where the 
assignment is on the certificate itself, because if for 
any reason the separate document should become 
detached from the certificate, the transferee's right 
would not be apparent, and therefore the Transfer 
of Stock Act provides that if a purchaser should get 
possession of the stock certificate with an indorse- 
ment upon it, he would take precedence over even a 

238 



COMMERCIAL LAW 239 

prior assignee who had a separate paper assigning 
the certificate to him. Of course, after the transfer 
is duly registered on the books of the company, then 
it makes no difference whether that transfer was se- 
cured by means of a separate power or assignment 
or by means of one written on the certificate itself. 
EFFECT OF TRANSFER ON THE BOOKS 
OF THE COMPANY.â€” What is the effect of trans- 
fer on the books of the company? Under the com- 
mon law, stock was originally transferable just like 
any intangible right, merely by agreement of the 
parties, to which requirement was added, as a neces- 
sity when stock certificates became common, the de- 
livery of the certificate itself. But it was convenient 
for the company to know who was owner of its stock. 
It was inconvenient to have stockholders buy and sell 
without any notice to the company, and therefore a 
common by-law was that stock should be transferred 
only on the books of the company. The Uniform 
Transfer of Stock Act goes back partially to the old 
rule, since the transfer of the certificate with the in- 
dorsement or separate assignment is what transfers 
the stock, not the transfer on the books of the com- 
pany; but in order that the corporation may not be 
inconvenienced it is provided that the corporation 
shall have the right to pay dividends to any one reg- 
istered on the books of the company, such persons 
being the apparent owners, and that only such per- 
sons have the right to vote. An analogous custom 
that shows the importance of registration of stock 
transfers on the books of the company is the registry 



240 COMMERCIAL LAW 

of deeds in the transfer of real estate. It is the deed, 
not the record of it, which creates a title, but an un- 
recorded deed may be defeated by creditors or pur- 
chasers! without notice, so that to protect himself 
fully the owner of land is obliged to record his deed. 
OWNERSHIP OF STOCK, INDIVIDUAL- 
LY, IN COMMON, JOINTLY AND BY FIDU- 
CIARIES. â€” Stock may be owned by a man in- 
dividually, it may be owned by several persons in 
common, or it may be owned by several persons joint- 
ly, or it may be owned by a person in a fiduciary ca- 
pacity, as trustee, executor or guardian. What is the 
difference, may be asked, between the case of owner- 
ship of stock by several persons in common and 
ownership by several persons jointly. The common 
law drew this distinction between joint right and 
rights merely held in common; that a joint right sur- 
vived to the survivors when one of them died, whereas 
a right held in common passed, on the death of one 
of the owners, pro rata to the personal representa- 
tives of the deceased. Therefore if A, B and C own 
stock jointly, when C dies A and B are the owners. 
If A, B and C own the stock in common. A, B and the 
executors of C would own it on the death of C. Gen- 
erally where several persons own a right now, they 
own it in common, but there are two notable excep- 
tions â€” the case of partnerships and the case of trus- 
tees. Stock held in the name o^ A, B and C, when 
A, B and C are either partners or trustees, will pass 
to A and B on the death of C. C's executor will not 
have to join in the transfer. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 241 

DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSFER AFFECT 
PURCHASER AND ALSO CORPORATION.â€” 

The difficulties in the transfer of stock may be looked 
at (1) from the standpoint of a purchaser of the stock, 
including within the name of purchaser one who lends 
money on the stock as well as one who buys it, and 
(2) from the standpoint of the corporation whose 
duty it is to transfer the stock on its books. Gen- 
erally the difficulties which confront the purchaser 
are the same which confront the corporation when it 
is asked to transfer. If the purchaser should get a 
defective right when he bought, then the corporation, 
if it should transfer, would generally get into trouble 
also. 

LEGAL AND EQUITABLE DIFFICULTIES 
IN TRANSFERS.â€” The main difficulties which arise 
may be divided into legal and equitable difficulties. 
By legal difficulties are meant cases in which the pur- 
chaser will not get a good legal title. By equitable 
difficulties, cases in which the purchaser will get a 
good legal title but which will be subject to an equit- 
able right in favor of some other person. The person 
who has an equitable right cannot reclaim the stock 
from one who is, or succeeds to the rights of, a bona 
fide purchaser for value without notice. 

LEGAL DIFFICULTIESâ€” FORGED CER- 
TIFICATE.â€” First, in regard to legal difficulties. 
The certificate of stock may be forged. The pur- 
chaser of a forged certificate of stock, of course, gets 
nothing in the way of stock. He does get the right, 
however, to sue the person who sold him the stock on 



242 COMMERCIAL LAW 

an implied warranty of genuineness. Analogous to 
the situation of the purchaser is the situation of the 
corporation if, on receiving a forged certificate with 
a request for a transfer, it should transfer ownership 
on the books, completing the transfer by issuing a 
new certificate ; for any person who took the new cer- 
tificate, even though he was a bona fide purchaser for 
value, would not get any stock in the corporation, if 
all authorized stock had previously been issued. The 
corporation has no power to overissue stock; it can- 
not emit any more even if it tries, and therefore 
the purchaser gets no stock. He does, however, get 
a right against the corporation. The corporation has 
issued what purports to be new stock to him, or if 
he is a remote purchaser he has paid for stock in re- 
liance on a certificate which the corporation has is- 
sued. The corporation is estopped, as the legal 
phrase is, to deny the validity of that certificate as 
against one who has thus relied on its acts. The re- 
sult is that the corporation is bound to pay to him 
value equivalent to that of real stock, because the 
corporation has put out something which seems to 
be good stock, and owing to the act of the corpora- 
tion the purchaser has been deceived. 

FORGED ASSIGNMENTS.â€” A second legal 
difficulty arises where the indorsement or assignment 
of the certificate is forged. Only the owner of stock 
can sell it. Consequently, if anybody else attempts 
by forgery or otherwise to make a transfer, the trans- 
fer will be ineffectual. The result will be the same as 
though the whole certificate were forged. The pur- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 243 

chaser under the forged indorsement will get noth- 
ing. If the corporation relies on the forged indorse- 
ment and issues a new certificate, it will, in the same 
way as in the case of a new certificate issued for a 
wholly forged one, be liable to a purchaser for value. 
It is, of course, of vital importance, therefore, to make 
sure that indorsements are correct, and generally it 
is desirable to take indorsed certificates only from 
reliable persons. If you take such a certificate from 
a reliable person, even though there is no express 
guaranty of signatures by a brokerage house or other 
third person, as there often is, you will be practically 
safe because of the implied warranty of genuineness 
by the seller which applies to the indorsement on cer- 
tificates as well as to cases of wholly forged certifi- 
cates. 

ASSIGNMENTS BY UNAUTHORIZED 
AGENT. â€” A third case is where the indorsement is 
made by an agent, and the agent has no authority to 
act. A corporation transferring stock should require, 
and a purchaser should require, the clearest evidence 
of an agent's authority if the signature of the trans- 
feror is made by an agent. It is not only necessary 
to be sure that the agent's authority originally ex- 
isted, but it is necessary to be sure that his power has 
not been revoked, either by the death of the principal 
or by express revocation during his life. A question 
that sometimes is troublesome, in regard to the agent's 
authority to make such an indorsement, arises where 
the terms of the power given the agent are general; 
where he is authorized to do a very broad class of 



244 COMMERCIAL LAW 

acts for the principal, but no specific mention is made 
of the particular certificate which he seeks to trans- 
fer. Such a power, if it certainly includes the transfer 
of that certificate, is legally good, but a corporation 
would object to make a transfer under a power which 
did not specifically mention the particular certificate, 
unless it was absolutely certain from its terms that 
this certificate in question was included. 

LACK OF CAPACITY TO ASSIGN.â€” A fourth 
case is lack of capacity on the part of the owner of the 
stock to make a transfer. This lack of capacity may 
arise from a variety of causes, insanity or infancy, 
for instance. A totally insane person is as incapable 
of transferring stock as of transferring other prop- 
erty. An infant, that is, a minor, though not wholly 
without capacity, if not under guardianship, becomes, 
presumably, wholly without capacity to transfer stock 
if under guardianship. An elderly person under the 
charge of a conservator would be incapacitated to 
transfer his property. An infant who has had no guar- 
dian appointed, though he could make a transfer, could 
also, by virtue of his infant's privilege, revoke that 
transfer, which, therefore, would be too insecure 
either for a purchaser to take or for a corporation to 
allow. If stock is owned by an infant, a purchaser or 
a corporation should require that a guardian be ap- 
pointed and that the transfer be made by the guar- 
dian. 

LACK OF DELIVERYâ€” THEFT OF CER- 
TIFICATE. â€” A fifth case is where the signature on 
the back of the certificate of stock is genuine, but 



COMMERCIAL LAW 245 

where there has been no valid delivery by the owner. 
This is rather a troublesome case to detect. In the 
case of full negotiable instruments, like bills and 
notes, if the signature of an indorser is genuine, a 
purchaser for value of the instrument will get title 
even though he purchases from a thief, or though for 
any reason there was no intention on the part of the 
owner who wrote his name on the back to make a 
transfer of the instrument. But by the common law 
stock certificates were not negotiable to this extent. 
This case occurred in a law office in Boston: the 
head of the firm rather carelessly kept "street certifi- 
cates" for stock (that is, certificates made out in the 
name of the brokerage firm which was the former 
owner and indorsed in blank) , not having the certifi- 
cates transferred to his own name. The stock was 
not at the time dividend-paying, so that a transfer 
on the books seemed unimportant. He put the cer- 
tificates into the office safe to which the office boy had 
access. This boy took the certificates and sold them 
through a broker, and the loss was not discovered for 
several years. After it was discovered the loss was 
traced by the numbers of the certificates, and action 
was brought against the brokers who were unfor- 
tunate enough to have taken the stock from the office 
clerk. Now, if the certificates had been negotiable 
paper, the brokers would not have been liable, but 
under the law then existing it seemed so probable 
that they were liable that they settled the case by pay- 
ing more than half the value of the stock. The only 
thing that could have prevented their being liable was 



246 COMMERCIAL LAW 

that, under the circumstances, the contention was pos- 
sible that the owner of the stock had been so negli- 
gent in his dealing with the certificates as to preclude 
him from asserting any right. Now the Transfer of 
Stock Act changes the law in this respect so far as 
Massachusetts stock certificates are concerned. The 
act makes them fully negotiable, but the common law 
would apparently still apply to certificates of stock of 
corporations incorporated in other States. And simi- 
lar principles would be applicable in other States 
which have passed the same statute. 

DEATH OF OWNER OF INDORSED CER- 
TIFICATE. â€” A somewhat similar case is this: sup- 
pose that after the owner of stock has written his 
name on the back of it, he dies; that is a common 
enough case. Many men have used their stock cer- 
tificates to borrow money on, and therefore, after pay- 
ing the loan they have them in their possession with 
their signatures on the back. They put those certifi- 
cates back in their safe deposit boxes. Then sup- 
pose the owner dies and an attempt is made to transfer 
the stock by virtue of that signature written on the 
certificate. That is not a valid transfer at common 
law. The certificate was owned only up to the time 
of his death by the man whose name is on the face; 
on his death his executor becomes the owner and the 
executor's signature is necessary to transfer the title, 
and the signature of the man himself written before 
his death is not effective for that purpose; and yet a 
purchaser may not be aware that that signature is 
invalid ; he may not know that the man who signed 



COMMERCIAL LAW 247 

it is dead, and similarly the corporation may allow 
the transfer to go through in ignorance that the signer 
is dead. If the money which is the proceeds of the 
stock actually reaches the executor of the estate, of 
course he could not object to the validity of the trans- 
fer, and he could not object if he were in any way a 
party to the transfer of the stock by means of the 
signature of the dead man; but if the proceeds did not 
get to the hands of the executor and he was in no way 
responsible for the transfer, he could assert that the 
transfer was invalid and that that stock belonged to 
him. This, again, is changed by the uniform law so 
far as applies to corporations in the States which have 
enacted that law. To avoid misapprehension it should 
be said that if an indorsed certificate has been deliv- 
ered for value by the owner, during his lifetime, to a 
purchaser or lender, the death of the indorser does not 
impair the validity of the signature even at common 
law. The purchase of the stock or a loan made 
on the stock gives the purchaser or lender a 
power which cannot be revoked by death or other- 
wise. 

BANKRUPTCY OF THE OWNER OF 

STOCK. â€” One other important case, in which a gen- 
uine signature of one who was the owner cannot 
transfer a good title, is the case of bankruptcy. The 
Federal bankruptcy law provides absolutely that title 
to property which a bankrupt has at the time of his 
bankruptcy shall be vested in his trustee. If, there- 
fore, after A's bankruptcy, A seeks to transfer stock 
which he had owned, and which was in his own name, 



248 COMMERCIAL LAW 

he cannot do so, for he is no longer the owner of the 
stock, and he has no power to transfer it. There- 
fore, even a bona fide purchaser from a bankrupt will 
get nothing. 

ATTACHMENT OF STOCK.â€” A sixth difficul- 
ty in regard to transfer of stock â€” -attachment of the 
stock by a creditor of the registered owner â€” is elimi- 
nated in States where the Uniform Transfer Act has 
been enacted. Such attachments created considerable 
difficulty before the passage of the act. Suppose this 
case : A is the owner on the books of the company of 
100 shares of Boston & Albany stock. He knows a 
creditor is about to attach that stock, and in order to 
get ahead of the creditor he sells the stock on the ex- 
change. If he makes the sale before the attachment, 
undoubtedly the sale everywhere would prevail over 
the subsequent attachment; but suppose the attach- 
ment preceded by a little while the sale of the stock. 
A still has the certificate, and brokers and purchasers 
are accustomed to rely on the certificate as evidence of 
ownership. They take the certificate and pay A 
money for it; then when the purchaser goes to trans- 
fer the stock he finds that an attachment has been 
put upon the books of the company. Where the uni- 
form law governs the case the only way to make an 
attachment of stock effective is to seize the certifi- 
cate itself. But in other States this difficulty may still 
arise, of a purchaser being deceived by the certificate 
itself, and paying money on the faith of it when there 
has been an attachment levied by a creditor imme- 
diately before on the books of the company. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 249 

TRANSFERS BETWEEN HUSBAND AND 
WIFE. â€” One other matter of transfer deserves at- 
tention, and that is a transfer between husband and 
wife, or wife and husband. A married woman can 
contract in most States as fully as a married man, but 
generally, though not universally, neither of them 
can contract with the other or make a conveyance di- 
rectly to the other. A promissory note from wife to 
husband, or husband to wife, or any other conveyance 
or transfer or contract was at common law and still 
is in many States invalid. A husband can, however, 
appoint his wife his agent, and a wife can appoint her 
husband her agent, and when such an agent acts, his 
act will be legally that of the principal, just as in any 
other case of agency. Accordingly, if a husband 
draws a check payable to his wife, though he does not 
become liable as drawer to his wife, and could not be 
sued by her if the check was not paid, the bank runs 
no risk in paying the check because the husband has 
authorized the bank to make a pa3nnent to the wife. 
Similarly, if a husband authorizes a corporation to 
transfer stock to his wife it seems that the corpora- 
tion is protected, having acted under the authority of 
the owner, and that the wife would get a good title to 
the stock. This question has, however, been some- 
what disputed by lawyers. Therefore it is very prob- 
able that a corporation would, as a matter of precau- 
tion, refuse to run any risk by transferring directly 
from husband to wife or vice versa, but would require 
that the transfer should be made through a third per- 
son in any State where husband and wife cannot con- 



250 COMMERCIAL LAW 

tract with one another. So much for difficulties aris- 
ing out of defects caused by the lack of legal title to 
the stock. 

STOCK HELD IN TRUST.â€” Now let us con- 
sider equitable defects.* Such defects chiefly arise 
where stock is held in trust. It would be the simplest 
and pleasantest thing for a corporation if it could re- 
fuse to register stock in trust at all, but it has been 
decided that it cannot do this, that it is bound, if re- 
quested, to register stock in favor of a trustee and 
issue stock to trustees. Now trustees hold under an 
appointment by the court. A trustee may cease to be 
such at any time by removal of the court as well as by 
death. Suppose stock in the name of D, trustee. If 
D has ceased to be trustee because he has been re- 
moved from office, a transfer by him will not be valid. 
Accordingly, it is essential for a corporation and for 
a purchaser to be certain, not simply that D was trus- 
tee, but that D is trustee at the time he attempts to 
make the transfer. We may suppose the case of a 
certificate which does not state that there is a trust. 
Not infrequently trustees, to avoid complications, do 
not specify in the certificate that they are trustees. 
If the corporation or if the purchaser of that stock 
has no notice that D is really holding that stock in 
trust, the corporation or the purchaser will have the 
same rights as if there were no trust. But if either 
the corporation or the purchaser learns, from ex- 
trinsic sources, that the stock is really held in trust, 
they will be bound to make certain that the seller is 
still empowered to act as trustee, in the same way as 



COMMERCIAL LAW 251 

if the certificate specifically stated on its face that 
the stock was owned by D in the capacity of trustee. 

ONE HAVING NOTICE THAT STOCK 
IS HELD IN TRUST MUST ASCERTAIN THE 
TERMS OF THE TRUST.â€” Even if the supposed 
trustee is actually the trustee he may not have power 
to give a good title to the stock. He has the legal 
title, undoubtedly, but if the certificate contains notice 
that he holds the legal title as trustee, every one is 
bound at his peril when purchasing the stock, and also 
the corporation is bound at its peril before it allows 
the transfer of the stock, to make sure that the trus- 
tee is authorized by the terms of his trust to transfer 
the stock. 

A TRUSTEE HAS POWERS NECESSARY 
TO CARRY OUT TERMS OF TRUST.â€” Generally 
when a transfer of stock is attempted by a trustee it 
means that the trustee is selling the stock, though that 
is not necessarily the case. A trust may be termi- 
nated ; that is, a trust may be created for twenty years, 
with directions to the trustee to transfer the trust 
property at the end of twenty years to certain benefi- 
ciaries. A transfer by the trustee at the close of the 
twenty years to the beneficiaries would not be a sale 
of the stock ; it would be a transfer for the purpose of 
carrying out the trust, and a trustee always has im- 
plied power to make any transfer of stock that is 
necessary to carry out the purpose of the trust. 

A TRUSTEE HAS NO IMPLIED POWER 
TO SELL. â€” A trustee has no implied power to sell. 
The general duty of a trustee is to keep the property 



252 COMMERCIAL LAW 

which is left to him in trust or conveyed to him in 
trust in its existing form, and no power is implied to 
change the form to something else. Accordingly, if 
no power to sell is in terms given in a trust created by 
deed or will, a corporation will require, and a pur- 
chaser should require, the trustee to obtain the au- 
thority of the probate court to make the sale. Care- 
fully drawn trusts generally contain a power for the 
trustee to sell if the purpose of the trust is to produce 
an income-bearing fund for a long period of years. 
For that purpose a change of investment is frequently 
desirable, and therefore trustees are expressly given 
that power. But the corporation which has issued a 
certificate to a trustee and a purchaser from the trus- 
tee must find out at their peril whether such a power 
is given. 

A TRUSTEE HAS NO IMPLIED POWER 
TO PLEDGE. â€” Another power, and one which is not 
commonly given, is the power to borrow on stock, to 
pledge it or use it for collateral security. Such a 
power is not implied and is not commonly given in 
trust deeds or wills. Therefore, a bank or other lender 
should not lend on certificates of stock which are 
made out to the borrower as trustee, or made out to 
any one as trustee. Of course, it is improper, even 
though the trust did give power to borrow, to allow 
the trustee not only to borrow money on trust securi- 
ties but to use the money borrowed as part of his own 
assets; that is, to put it in his ov^oi general account. 
It is his duty to keep trust money separate, and there- 
fore if the trustee has power to borrow he should keep 



COMMERCIAL LAW 253 

the funds which he borrows earmarked as trust prop- 
erty; but as has been said, he will rarely have power 
given him expressly to borrow even for trust purposes. 

A TRUSTEE CANNOT TRANSFER TO 
HIMSELF. â€” Suppose a trustee is by a deed or will 
given power to sell and he asks the corporation to 
make a transfer of the stock to himself. The corpora- 
tion should not do it. He has power to sell to any one 
else but himself. A fiduciary cannot make a bargain 
with himself in regard to his trust property, and 
therefore he should not be allowed to transfer the 
stock to himself. 

A TRUSTEE CANNOT DELEGATE HIS 
POWER TO SELL.â€” A trustee cannot delegate his 
powers, and therefore he cannot give a general power 
of attorney to another, to sell trust stock or any trust 
property whenever it may seem wise to the agent to 
do so. Even though the trustee has himself power to 
sell, he must exercise his own discretion as to the oc- 
casion when it is proper to sell. 

PURCHASER FROM A TRUSTEE IS NOT 
BOUND TO SEE TO APPLICATION OF PUR- 
CHASE MONEY.â€” Though the corporation and 
though the purchaser from a trustee are bound to see, 
if they have notice of the trust by the form of the cer- 
tificate, that the trustee is not making an unauthor- 
ized sale, neither the purchaser nor the corporation is 
bound to see that the trustee does not make an im- 
proper application of the money received from sale of 
trust stock. In the current legal phrase, neither the 
purchaser nor the corporation is bound to see to the 



254 COMMERCIAL LAW 

application of the trust money ; but if either the pur- 
chaser or the corporation had notice of a proposed 
misapplication of the trust money to be received for 
the stock, it would be improper to allow the transfer 
knowing that the proceeds would be misapplied, and 
the corporation or the purchaser would be liable if 
the transfer was carried out. 

AN EXECUTOR HAS IMPLIED POWER 
TO SELL. â€” Stock held by a guardian or by an ex- 
ecutor is in many respects treated similarly to stock 
held by a trustee. There is this difference, however, 
in the executor's position, that as it is his duty to re- 
duce the estate to cash he has in most, but not all 
States, an implied power to sell; it does not have to be 
given to him in the will. The will, however, may re- 
strict an executor's right to sell certain stock, and 
therefore even in the case of an executor it would be 
proper for a corporation to m.ake sure that the ex- 
ecutor's power had not been restricted by the will 
before allowing the transfer. 

TRANSFER BY AN EXECUTOR TO A LEG- 
ATEE. â€” Generally the executor will seek to reduce 
the property to cash and therefore seek to transfer 
the stock in the estate to a purchaser, but he may try 
to transfer it directly to a legatee. He may himself 
be a legatee and endeavor to transfer to himself. Un- 
less he is a residuary legatee or a legatee of the specific 
stock in question it is as improper for him to transfer 
to himself as for a trustee to transfer to himself. Even 
though the executor is a pecuniary legatee or is en- 
titled to payment for commissions, he would have no 



COMMERCIAL LAW 255 

right to take stock in lieu of such pecuniary legacy or 
commission, for he cannot make such a bargain with 
himself though he might in regard to the legacy of 
another. If the executor is a specific or residuary leg- 
atee the question of a right to transfer to himself is 
the same as to transfer to any other legatee, and that 
right is only subject to one qualification. Creditors 
of an estate have the first right; legatees do not get 
their legacies paid unless creditors are taken care of 
first. Creditors have a fixed period from the time 
when executors or administrators give bonds within 
which to assert their claims. If they have not asserted 
their claims in that period the claims are barred. 
After that time has expired it is generally known 
whether the assets of the estate are sufficient to pay 
legacies, and it is usually then proper to allow a 
transfer to a legatee. Prior to that you run the risk â€” 
which may be in a particular case a very small one or 
it may be a very large one â€” that the creditors of the 
estate may exhaust the assets and the legatees not be 
entitled to anything. 

LOST CERTIFICATES. â€” â€¢ Occasionally a 
question arises in regard to a lost certificate. The 
Uniform Law provides for' this case in substantially 
the same way as the common law would deal with it 
if there were no statute, namely, the corporation may 
demand a bond to indemnify it before it issues a new 
certificate. This bond is essential because should the 
old certificate turn up and be transferred to a bona 
fide purchaser for value, the corporation would be 
liable on the old certificate, and as it would also be 



256 COMMERCIAL LAW 

liable to a purchaser for value of the new certificate it 
is necessary that it should have a bond to protect it. 

INTERPLEADER OF SEVERAL CLAIM- 
ANTS FOR STOCK.â€” If there are several claimants 
for stock, as sometimes happens, the corporation 
should file a bill of interpleader, as it is called, against 
the several claimants, asking the court to determine 
which one is rightfully entitled. An instance of that 
kind would be where A asks a corporation to transfer 
stock to him, presenting a certificate indorsed by B, 
but B notifies the corporation that he has been de- 
frauded out of that stock by A, and that he elects to 
rescind the transfer to A and demands the certificate 
back. The corporation cannot undertake to deter- 
mine which of these parties is in the right ; it must ask 
the court to do so. Not infrequently the same situa- 
tion arises in a bank where money has been lent on 
stock, and notice is given to the bank not to return 
that security to the borrower because he obtained it 
fraudulently or otherwise has acted in violation of the 
rights of a third person in pledging it to the bank. 
The bank, if it is a bona fide lender, is, of course, en- 
titled to hold the stock for its own security so far as 
it may be necessary to repay the loan; but perhaps the 
bank can get the loan repaid out of other securities un- 
questionably belonging to the borrower. In that 
event the bank should do so and then ask the court 
who is entitled to the disputed stock. 

EFFECT OF) DELIVERING UNINDORSED 
CERTIFICATE. â€” In order to transfer stock, as pre- 
viously said, it is necessary that the stock should be 



COMMERCIAL LAW 257 

either indorsed or that on a separate paper an assign- 
ment or power to transfer should be written. What 
is the effect of giving a certificate without either of 
these formalities? It virtually protects the person 
who receives the certificate, for though he has not 
title to the stock and cannot get title without an in- 
dorsement, he has the certificate in his possession 
which prevents any other person from getting title; 
and, furthermore, he has the right to require an in- 
dorsement from the person whose indorsement is 
needed, provided, of course, that the holder of the cer- 
tificate took it from the owner, who impliedly or ex- 
pressly agreed that he should have title. If somebody 
not an owner of a certificate delivered it without in- 
dorsement to a bank, and borrowed money on it, the 
bank would not be protected. The true owner could 
say, "That is mine," and take it away. 



CHAPTER VIII 



PROPERTY DEFINED.â€” Property in the strict 
legal sense, is the aggregate of rights which one 
may lawfully exercise over particular things to 
the exclusion of others. "If a man were alone in the 
world," says Kant, "he could properly hold or acquire 
nothing as his own; because between himself, as Per- 
son, and all other outward objects, as Things, there 
is no relation. The relation is between him and other 
people, whom he excludes from the thing." All things 
are not the subject of property, because, the sea, 
the air, light, and similar things, cannot be appro- 
priated. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” An illustration that gives 
us the idea of property will make our definition clear. 
A takes his shoes to a cobbler to be repaired. When 
he calls for them, he does not have the price for the 
work, and the cobbler refuses to give them up. Both 
A and the cobbler have a property right in the shoes. 
The right to absolute ownership is in A, that is his 
property right. The temporary possession, however, 
is in the cobbler, and he may hold the shoes under the 
lien for repairs indefinitely and until he receives his 
compensation. The lien is his property right. When 
we use the term property in its lowest form we mean 
by it the right of possession. In our illustration, the 
cobbler's lien gives him the right of possession. When 
we use the term in its highest form, we mean the right 

258 



COMMERCIAL LAW 259 

of exclusive ownership; in our illustration, A's shoes 
after he has paid the repair bill and secured the sl\oes 
again. 

THE RIGHTS OF OWNERSHIP.â€” Exchi5;ive 
ownership implies : 

1. The right of exclusive possession for an inde- 
terminate time. 

2. The right of exclusive enjoyment for an inde- 
terminate time. 

3. The right of disposition. 

4. The right of recovery if the thing be wrong- 
fully taken or withheld. 

But, you say, this is not the idea one ordinarily 
has of the term "property." One speaks thus of his 
watch : "I own this watch. It is my property." The 
answer is, property is a term with a double meaning. 
In the ordinary sense "property" indicates the thing 
itself, rather than the rights attached to it. There- 
fore it is that we have a law of personal property, and 
a law of real property. 

PERSONAL PROPERTY AND REAL PROP- 
ERTY DISTINGUISHED.â€” Real property has been 
defined to be co-extensive v/ith lands, tenem.ents, and 
hereditaments ; to put it more simply, we may say that 
it consists of land and anything that is permanently 
affixed to the land. Personal property embraces all 
objects which are capable of ownership except land. 
One fundamental difference between the two is that 
real property is generally considered to be immovable, 
while such property as is movable is usually termed 
personal property. It is important that the distinc- 



260 COMMERCIAL LAW 

tion between the two forms of property be kept in 
mind because different results follow where the prop- 
erty is held to be one or the other. For example, on 
the death of the owner of real property, it passes to 
his heir or devisee, while in the case of personal prop- 
erty, it goes to the personal representative, the execu- 
tor or the administrator, and through him to the lega- 
tee or distributee. Again, in settling the estate of the 
deceased person, personal property is always to be 
used first to pay the decedent's debts. The modes of 
transferring personal property and real property dif- 
fer. Real property is transferred by deed. Personal 
property may be transferred without any writing and 
even in the case of a transfer of personal property, by 
a bill of sale, the requirements for recording it are 
generally quite different from those relating to the 
recording of deeds. Again, the transfer of real prop- 
erty is governed by the law of the place where the real 
property is situated, whereas the transfer of personal 
property is governed by the law of the domicile of the 
owner. Taxation is another subject where the distinc- 
tion is most important. 

SALES OF PERSONAL PROPERTY.â€” The 
most important branch of the law of personal prop- 
erty, in the field of commercial law, is that relating to 
the sale of personal property. We shall confine the 
balance of this chapter to a consideration of that sub- 
ject. As we have a uniform Negotiable Instruments 
Law, so we also have a Uniform Sales Act which has 
now been adopted in many of the States. The Sales 
Act defines a sale and a contract to sell as follows: 



COMMERCIAL LAW 261 

(1) A contract to sell goods is a contract whereby the 
seller agrees to transfer the property in goods to the 
buyer for a consideration called the price. (2) A sale 
of goods is an agreement whereby the seller transfers 
the property in goods to the buyer for a consideration 
called the price. (3) A contract to sell or a sale may 
be absolute or conditional. (4) There may be a con- 
tract to sell or a sale between one part owner and 
another. 

SALES AND CONTRACTS TO SELL.â€” Sales 
are to be distinguished from contracts to sell. A sale 
is an actual transfer of property, whereas a contract 
to sell is an agreement to make a sale in the future. 
Sales at a shop, for instance, are made without any 
contract to sell, but orders for goods at a distance, 
and agreements to ship them, frequently precede the 
actual sale of the goods, which is made in pursuance 
of the prior contract to sell. The sale of personal 
property is subject to different rules from the sale of 
real estate. In the transfer of real estate, formalities 
of deed and seal are necessary, which are not required 
in personal property, and the subjects must be con- 
sidered separately. 

A SALE DISTINGUISHED FROM SIMILAR 
TRANSACTIONS.â€” At the outset, a sale must be 
distinguished from several other similar transactions. 
The law of sales is a branch of contract law, hence 
consideration is necessary in a sale. A gift, on the 
other hand, which may result in the transfer of per- 
sonal property in practically the same manner as a 
sale, does not require any consideration. Hence, an 



262 COMMERCIAL LAW 

agreement to sell goods is unenforceable if not sup- 
ported by consideration. A promise to make a gift is 
always unenforceable because the very idea of a gift 
negatives any idea of consideration. A sale and a bail- 
ment must also be distinguished. A bailment is the 
rightful holding of an article of personal property by 
one, for the accomplishment of a certain purpose, with 
an obligation to return it after the completion of that 
purpose. Where there is a sale, the entire property 
right passes to the nev/ buyer, and if the article is 
destroyed, providing title has passed, the new buyer 
must pay the purchase price if he has not already done 
so, although he gets nothing for it. In a bailment, 
the title does not pass. The case of the cobbler repair- 
ing the shoes is an illustration of a bailment. If, while 
the shoes are in his possession, his shop is burned, 
through no fault of his, the owner of the shoes would 
stand the loss. If I borrow a person's automobile, and 
while using it the car is struck by lightning and totally 
destroyed, the loss falls on the owner because this also 
is a bailment. On the other hand, had I bought the 
car and temporarily kept it in the seller's garage, 
awaiting the completion of my own garage, and it is 
burned while in his garage, the loss is mine. By such a 
transaction, I become the owner when the sale is made, 
and the former ovv^ner becomes the bailee. 

FORMALITIES NECESSARY FOR THE 
COMPLETION OF A SALE.â€” The Sales Act pro- 
vides in section 3, subject to a few provisions, that "a 
contract to sell or a sale may be made in writing 
(either with or without seal), or by word of mouth, 



COMMERCIAL LAW 263 

or partly in writing and partly by word of mouth, 
or may be inferred from the conduct of the parties." 
The main qualification of the right to make an oral 
sale or contract to sell is found in the next section 
(Section 4) which is virtually a copy of a similar pro- 
vision in the English Statute of Frauds in regard to 
the sale of personal property. Section 4 reads as fol- 
lows: 

"(1) A contract to sell or a sale of any goods or 
choses in action of the value of five hundred dollars or 
upwards shall not be enforceable by action unless the 
buyer shall accept part of the goods or choses in action 
so contracted to be sold, and actually receive the same, 
or give something in earnest to bind the contract, or in 
part payment, or unless some note or memorandum in 
writing of the contract or sale be signed by the party 
to be charged or his agent in that behalf. 

"(2) The provisions of this section apply to every 
such contract or sale, notwithstanding that the goods 
may be intended to be delivered at some future time 
or may not at the time of such contract or sale be ac- 
tually made, procured, or provided, or fit or ready for 
delivery, or some act may be requisite for the making 
or completing thereof, or rendering the same fit for 
delivery; but if the goods are to be manufactured by 
the seller especially for the buyer and are not suitable 
for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's 
business, the provisions of this section shall not 
apply. 

"(3) There is an acceptance of goods within the 
meaning of this section when the buyer, either before 



264 COMMERCIAL LAW 

or after delivery of the goods, expresses by words or 
conduct his assent to becoming the owner of those 
specific goods." 

THE CAPACITY OF PARTIES.â€” The Sales 
Act provides in section 2 that "capacity to buy and sell 
is regulated by the general law concerning capacity to 
contract, and transfer and acquire property. Where 
necessaries are sold and delivered to an infant, or to a 
person who by reason of mental incapacity or drunk- 
enness is incompetent to contract, he must pay a rea- 
sonable price therefor. Necessaries in this section 
mean goods suitable to the condition in life of such 
infant or other person, and to his actual requirements 
at the time of delivery." 

IMPORTANCE O F DISTINGUISHING 
SALE AND CONTRACT TO SELL.â€” Why is it im- 
portant to distinguish between a contract to sell and a 
sale; what difference does it make whether title has 
passed or not? The primary reason that it makes a 
difference is because as soon as the title has been 
transferred from the seller to the buyer the seller is 
entitled to the price. Prior to the transfer of title, 
if the buyer refused to take the goods, the seller would 
be entitled only to damages, which would be the dif- 
ference between the value of the goods which the 
seller still retained and the price which was promised. 
If the goods were worth as much or more than the 
amount of the price promised, the seller would not be 
entitled to any substantial damages. But after title 
has passed the buyer must pay the full price, and the 
seller may recover it if the buyer refuses to accept 



COMMERCIAL LAW 265 

delivery. Another consequence flowing from the 
transfer of title is that the goods are thereafter at the 
risk of the buyer. If they are destroyed by accident 
the buyer must nevertheless pay the price, for the 
right to the price accrued before the goods were de- 
stroyed, and when they were destroyed they were at 
the buyer's risk. Bankruptcy is another circumstance 
which makes it important to determine who holds title 
to the goods. If the buyer becomes bankrupt, after 
title to the goods has passed to him, his trustee in 
bankruptcy takes the goods for his creditors, but if 
he becomes bankrupt before title has passed that 
would not be true. The bankruptcy of the seller would 
make a similar difference. 

WHEN TITLE IS PRESUMED TO PASS.â€” 
There are several presumptions in the law as to when 
title will be presumed to pass if there was no specific 
agreement between the parties as to when it should 
pass. If they simply bargain for the goods without 
saying anything about the time when the buyer is to 
become the owner, the first presumption is that title 
passes as soon as the goods are specified and the par- 
ties are agreed on the terms of the bargain, even 
though no part of the price has been paid and though 
the goods have not been delivered. It is often as- 
sumed that delivery is essential to transfer title to 
goods, but that is not so, though delivery is strong 
evidence of intent to transfer title. If the parties have 
made their bargain, and definitely agreed on the terms 
of the bargain, title passes even though possession of 
the goods still remains in the hands of the seller. The 



266 COMMERCIAL LAW 

seller, however, has a lien for the price though he has 
parted with title. As long as the goods are in his 
possession he may refuse to surrender until he is paid 
the price, unless he agreed to sell on credit. 

TITLE PASSES WHEN PARTIES AGREE. 
â€” It is only a presumption that, where the terms of a 
bargain are fixed and the goods are specified, title 
passes at once, for if the parties agree that title shall 
not pass at once it will pass when and as they agree. 
Their intention in regard to the transfer of title may 
not be stated in express terms, and it may be gathered 
only from the acts or words of the parties. If some- 
thing remains to be done to the goods by the seller, to 
put them in a deliverable condition, that indicates an 
intent that title shall not pass until they are in the con- 
dition agreed upon. If the parties provide that the 
goods shall be stored at the expense of the seller, for 
a time or at the risk of the seller, that indicates title is 
not intended to pass, for if they are at the seller's ex- 
pense and risk, presumably they are still his goods. 
On the other hand, delivery of the goods indicates an 
intent to pass title, although it is possible, if the par- 
ties so agree, that title does not pass even though the 
goods are delivered. Again, payment of the price is 
evidence tending to show an intent to pass title, for 
buyers do not ordinarily pay the price in advance. It 
is not uncommon for credit to be given by the seller, 
but it is uncommon for the buyer to pay first ; but even 
that is not impossible, and therefore, though payment 
of the price is evidence of an intent to transfer title 
immediately, it is not conclusive evidence. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 267 

TRANSFER OF TITLE BY SUBSEQUENT 
APPROPRIATION.â€” Suppose title does not pass 
immediately, which may be due to the fact that the 
parties so agreed, or to the fact that the goods were 
not specified at the time the bargain was made. That 
is a common case. A and B contract for the sale of 100 
cases of shoes to be made by A. At the time the par- 
ties make their bargain the shoes have not yet been 
made, but the parties expect that they will be made 
later, and appropriated to the bargain, as the legal 
phrase is. Or title may not pass at the time the bar- 
gain is made, although the goods are specified. The 
parties may have expressly agreed that title should not 
pass; or though the goods are specified, something 
may remain to be done to them by the seller to put 
them in a deliverable condition. Now, if title for any 
of these reasons does not pass when the bargain is 
made, it may pass by an express agreement of the 
parties, made later, that the buyer shall take title and 
that the seller shall give title; or frequently it may 
pass by what is called an appropriation of the goods 
by the seller to the buyer, without any express later 
assent of the buyer, by virtue of an implied assent of 
the buyer given in the original agreement that the sel- 
ler should appropriate the goods. What is meant will 
be understood by one or two illustrations. 

APPROPRIATIONS BY DELIVERY TO A 
CARRIER. â€” Suppose A contracts to sell and ship to 
the buyer 100 cases of shoes, and B contracts to re- 
ceive and pay for them. That shipment to the buyer 
is an appropriation of the goods. The very 100 cases 



268 COMMERCIAL LAW 

with which the seller intends to fulfill the bargain are 
indicated by the delivery of them to the carrier, and 
the buyer, since he agreed in the first place that they 
should be shipped, has assented to the appropriation. 
Therefore, in such a case, as soon as the goods are 
delivered to the carrier the presumption is that title 
passes to the buyer. This is by far the commonest 
case of appropriation by the seller in accordance with 
authority given by the buyer in his original agree- 
ment, and it is so common that it deserves a little fur- 
ther treatment. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” This kind of appropriation 
can be very well illustrated by the case of a supposed 
sale of tobacco to a minor. A, a minor, lives in 
an outlying suburb of Boston where the sale of 
tobacco to a minor is not permitted. He buys goods 
of S. S. Pierce Company in Boston and wants to buy 
some cigars from them. He can buy cigars of them in 
Boston and send them out to his home, but the title 
must pass to him in Boston. If the title passes in the 
suburb it is an illegal sale by S. S. Pierce Company, 
and consequently they do not want to make it. Of 
course the buyer can go and get the goods and pay for 
them in Boston and send them himself to his resi- 
dence. But suppose he sends an order by mail ; if S. S. 
Pierce Company are willing to charge goods to him, 
giving him credit, they can send the goods by express, 
because on their shipment of the goods the title will 
pass and the buyer will become a debtor for the price 
of the goods in Boston; but they must not send the 
goods by their own wagon, as their carrying the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 269 

goods themselves out to the buyer's residence leaves 
them in their possession until delivery, and the de^ 
livery does not take place until the goods are deliv- 
ered from their wagon at his house. That would not 
do. Whereas if the goods are delivered to a public 
carrier in Boston the carrier would be the buyer's 
agent and title would pass in Boston. 

THE SELLER MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY 
AUTHORITY GIVEN HIM.â€” Suppose the buyer 
specified that the goods are to be shipped by a given 
route, and the seller shipped them by a different route. 
Title would not pass then because the buyer had not 
authorized the seller to appropriate them to him, the 
buyer, in that way. It may be that the seller's way of 
sending them was better than that originally assented 
to by the buyer, but the seller, if he wishes to hold the 
buyer, as owner of the goods from the time of ship- 
ment, must get his approval of that better way. Still 
more important than the method of shipment is the 
character of the goods themselves. The seller cannot, 
by putting any goods on the train, transfer title. He 
must put on the train the very kind of goods which the 
buyer agreed to receive, and that will mean not simply, 
in the case supposed, that the goods must be shoes, 
but they must be merchantable shoes of the character 
and sizes which the buyer agreed to take. The goods 
must be properly packed and all usual precautions in 
regard to them taken. In so far as the original agree- 
ment specified what was to be done, those things must 
be done. In so far as the original agreement does not 
specify how the goods are to be shipped, or what shall 



270 COMMERCIAL LAW 

be done in regard to them, the seller has discretion to 
do anything which is customary and proper for a care- 
ful business man. 

SHIPMENT OF GOODS C. O. D.â€” There has 
been considerable litigation in regard to the effect of 
shipping goods C. O. D. Suppose goods were ordered 
and goods of the sort ordered were shipped in accord- 
ance with the directions in the order, but were marked 
C. O. D. Those letters mean, as you know, collect on 
delivery, and two possible explanations may be given 
of their effect. One, that the seller retains not only 
control of, but also title to, the goods until they are 
delivered and the price paid. According to that view 
the carrier is made the seller's agent, to hold the title 
to the goods and transfer it to the buyer when he pays 
for the goods. But the better view is that the carrier 
merely retains a hold on the goods, a lien on behalf of 
the seller, while title to the goods passes on shipment. 

EFFECT OF THE FORM OF A BILL OF 
LADING. â€” One cannot speak of title passing or being 
retained on shipment of goods without referring to 
bills of lading, for the general rules which have been 
given must be qualified by this statement, that by 
means of a bill of lading the title may be at will re- 
tained or transferred (if the buyer has authorized a 
transfer). The proper v/ay to indicate a transfer of 
title when goods are shipped is to have the buyer 
named as consignee in the bill of lading. A bill of 
lading is very much like a promissory note ; the carrier 
promises to deliver the goods to somebody who is 
called the consignee, and who corresponds to the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 271 

payee of a note. There is this further feature in a bill 
of lading: the carrier acknowledges receipt of the 
goods from the consignor, that is, the shipper, and the 
carrier promises to deliver them. 

ILLUSTRATIONS.â€” Now, when S. S. Pierce 
Company decide to ship goods to a buyer, it may con- 
sign them to the buyer or it may consign them to 
itself ; that is, the same person may be consignor and 
consignee. That is very common in business, in order 
that the shipper may retain title to the goods until he 
receives payment. He takes the bill of lading in his 
own name and then, generally, attaches a draft on 
the buyer of the goods, and sends the bill of lading 
and the draft together through a bank. The bank 
notifies the drawee of the draft, who is the man who 
has agreed to buy the goods, that the bill of lading 
with the draft are at the bank, and that the buyer may 
have the bill of lading when he pays the draft. The 
buyer pays the draft and gets the bill of lading, and 
then for the first time does he become the owner of 
the goods. On the other hand, if the shipper â€” S. S. 
Pierce Company â€” had consigned the goods directly 
to the buyer, the buyer would have become the owner 
of the goods on shipment, provided the buyer had 
authorized that shipment. The seller cannot, how- 
ever, by naming a buyer consignee, make the buyer 
owner of any goods which he has not agreed to re- 
ceive. So much for appropriation of the goods to the 
buyer by shipment. In another chapter fuller refer- 
ence will be made to bills of lading as documents of 
title and as bank securities. In this connection they 



272 COMMERCIAL LAW 

are referred to merely as indicating an intention to 
transfer or retain title as between buyer and seller. 

IMPORTANCE OF DELIVERY IN SALES 
OF GOODS.â€” Title to chattel property, it has been 
said, may pass without delivery. This is true as be- 
tween the parties, but as against creditors and third 
persons delivery is necessary. Suppose A sells a horse 
to B and does not deliver the horse, and A afterwards 
sells the horse to C and does deliver the horse to C. 
B comes around to C and says, "That is my horse. I 
paid A the full price." C may say, "I bought him in 
good faith. I thought it was A's horse. I have got 
him and I am going to keep him." C may keep him. 

PLACE OF DELIVERY.â€” Certain contractual 
rights between the buyer and seller are implied from 
the nature of the bargain of sale. A seller is under an 
implied obligation not only to transfer title to the 
buyer, but to deliver possession to him. Where must 
the seller deliver possession? If the contract states 
the place, the terms of the contract decide that ques- 
tion. If the contract does not expressly state where 
the place is to be, the place of the seller's residence is 
the place where the seller is bound to deliver, unless 
the goods are too heavy for easy transportation, and 
in that case the place of delivery is the place where 
the goods are at the time of the bargain. That may be 
the seller's place of business, and it may not. 

DELIVERY AND PAYMENT ARE CON- 
CURRENT CONDITIONS. â€” Concurrently with 
the seller's duty to deliver possession, the buyer is 
under a duty to pay the price, unless the contract pro- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 273 

vides for a period of credit. The delivery and the pay- 
ment of the price are, in the absence of contrary 
agreement, concurrent conditions. The seller must 
offer to deliver if he wants to get a right of action for 
the price, and the buyer must tender payment if he 
wants a right of action for the goods. The tender of 
price and delivery must be at the place where pay- 
ment and delivery is due. It may be asked, how is the 
seller to tender the goods at the place delivery is due 
if that is the seller's place of business and the buyer 
does not appear? The answer is, that it is in effect a 
tender for the seller to have the goods in the place 
where they are to be delivered, he being ready and 
willing to deliver them. If the buyer does not come 
there the buyer must, nevertheless, pay the seller. By 
the seller's readiness to perform, at the place where 
performance is due, and deliver, if the buyer with his 
money is at the place where payment is due, there is 
in effect a tender. 

RIGHT OF INSPECTION.â€” The buyer and 
seller have certain other implied rights and duties. A 
right which the buyer always has, in the absence of 
agreement to the contrary, is a right to inspect the 
goods, to see that he is getting what he bargained for, 
before he accepts title and pays the price. He may, 
however, waive this right of inspection ; he may agree 
to pay the price without seeing what he is getting, 
and in modern business this is not uncommon. One 
sort of bargain frequently made contains this term: 
"Cash against bill of lading." That means the buyer 
is to pay the price of the goods on receiving the bill of 



274 COMMERCIAL LAW 

lading. The bill of lading will usually reach him be- 
fore the goods, and, therefore, before he has a chance 
to inspect; and by the terms of his bargain he has 
agreed to pay cash against the bill of lading and he 
must do so. Of course, if the goods when received 
turn out not to be what he bargained for, he has a 
right to sue for breach of contract or recovery of the 
price paid. But in the first place, when the bill of 
lading comes he has to assume that the goods are 
going to be right and pay for the bill of lading. An- 
other case where a right of inspection is waived is 
where goods are sent C. O. D. You order goods to be 
sent in that v/ay and the expressman brings them. 
You say you want to open the package and see if the 
goods are right. You will find the expressman will 
not let you. He will say, "No, you must pay for the 
sealed package," and until you do so, you will have no 
right to the possession of the goods. If the goods are 
not all right you have redress by suing the seller, but 
you must pay your money first. 

WARRANTIES. â€” Another and most important 
right which the buyer has is the enforcement of war- 
ranties. Warranties of a chattel may be either express 
or implied. An express warranty is a promise or an 
obligation imposed by the law because of a repre- 
sentation which the seller has made in regard to the 
goods. The simplest form of v/arranty is where the 
seller says, "I warrant this horse is sound," or, "I 
warrant this piano v/ill stay in tune for a year." These 
warranties are promises and are subject to the same 
rules as other promises. They are contracts for con- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 275 

sideration, the consideration for the promise being in 
each case the purchase of the goods. But we have 
warranties which are not based on promises, strictly 
so called, and yet are express. A tries to sell a horse. 
He says the horse is perfectly sound, four years old, 
broken to harness, and has trotted a mile in three 
minutes. Those are in form representations rather 
than promises; they are assertions of fact, and when 
A makes them it is possible he does not understand 
that he is binding himself for the truth of his state- 
ments; and yet if they are made as positive state- 
ments of fact, the seller is held to warrant the truth 
of those statements. 

REPRESENTATIONS OF FACT AND OF 
OPINION. â€” The great distinction, between warran- 
ties by representation and statements in regard to 
property which do not amount to express warranties, 
is that between statements of opinion and statements 
of positive fact. If the buyer said, "I believe the horse 
can trot a mile in three minutes any day," it is not a 
warranty; even the statement, "The horse can trot a 
mile in three minutes" would probably not be a war- 
ranty ; but the statement, "The horse has trotted a mile 
in three minutes," is a direct assertion of fact, and the 
element of opinion does not occur, and therefore 
that would be a warranty. Statements of value do 
not amount to warranties. Those are necessarily to 
some extent matters of opinion. General statements 
of good quality do not, ordinarily, amount to warran- 
ties. The courts, however, are getting stiffer and 
stiffer in regard to these matters. It used to be the 



276 COMMERCIAL LAW 

law that a seller could represent nearly anything he 
chose in regard to his goods, and not be bound, so long 
as he did not expressly say, "I warrant," or make a 
promise in terms in regard to them. That was called 
the rule of "caveat emptor" â€” "let the buyer beware" 
â€” but this rule is almost wiped out so far as repre- 
sentations of fact are concerned. Now, the seller had 
better beware of what he says, for he may find himself 
liable as a warrantor. 

NO WARRANTIES IMPLIED IN SALES OF 
REAL ESTATE. â€” There are certain warranties im- 
plied, although the buyer does not bargain for them 
and although the seller makes no express representa- 
tions regarding them. In this respect sales of personal 
property differ entirely from sales of real estate. In 
the case of real estate you get no warranty but what 
you bargain for. If you get a deed without words of 
warranty, and it turns out that the seller had no title, 
in the absence of fraud you have no redress; you can- 
not get your money back though you have no title to 
the land. 

WARRANTY OF TITLE IMPLIED IN 
SALES OF PERSONAL PROPERTY. â€” In the 
case of personal property it is otherwise. The first 
implied warranty that exists in the case of a sale of 
personalty, unless the contrary is expressly agreed, 
is the implied warranty of title. The seller impliedly 
warrants that he has title to the property and will 
transfer title to the buyer. The only exception to this 
is where a sale is made by a person in a representative 
capacity, as by a sheriff or an agent. In that case the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 277 

person making the sale does not impliedly warrant 
title. In the case of an agent, however, if the agent 
was authorized to make the sale, the principal would 
be liable as an implied warrantor of title; and if the 
agent was not authorized to make the sale, the agent 
would be liable as warranting his authority â€” not as 
warranting title to the goods, but warranting that he 
had a right to bind his principal. Even in the case of 
a sale by an agent, therefore, the purchaser gets sub- 
stantial redress if the title turns out to be defective. 
It is possible, of course, by express agreement, for a 
buyer to buy and a seller to sell merely such title as 
the seller may have; but there must be an express 
agreement, or very special circumstances, indicating 
that such was the intention of the parties, in order to 
induce a court to give this construction to a bargain. 
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF QUALITY IN 
SALES BY DESCRIPTION.â€” Not only are there 
implied warranties of title, but there are also implied 
warranties in regard to the quality of goods. The fun- 
damental principle at the bottom of implied warranty 
of quality of goods is this : if the buyer justifiably re- 
lies on the seller's skill or judgment to select proper 
goods, then the seller is liable if he does not deliver 
proper goods. We may distinguish in regard to im- 
plied warranties of quality, sales of specific goods â€” 
that is, sales of a particular thing â€” and sales of goods 
by description. In the case of sales by description 
there is always an implied warranty that the buyer 
shall have not only goods which answer that descrip- 
tion, but merchantable goods which answer that de- 



278 COMMERCIAL LAW 

scription. Suppose a seller contracts to sell so many 
hogsheads of Manila sugar. The law formerly was 
that the seller could tender to the buyer, in fulfillment 
of that contract, the worst article that he could find 
which bore the name of Manila sugar. The law at 
present is that the seller must furnish to the buyer 
merchantable Manila sugar; that is, Manila sugar of 
average and salable quality. It does not have to be 
the best, but it must be ordinarily salable as mer- 
chantable Manila sugar. 

IMPLIED WARRANTY IN SALES OF 
SPECIFIED GOODS.â€” Contrast with that case a 
contract to sell a specific identified lot of Manila sugar 
before the buyer and seller. Is the buyer bound to 
take without objection that specific lot, whether or 
not it turns out to be merchantable? Or suppose you 
go to a shop where they sell bicycles and buy a bicycle ; 
you pick out a specific bicycle, and it turns out that, 
owing to defects in manufacture, it is not good for 
anything. It breaks down the first time you ride it. 
May the seller say, "You looked at what we had in 
stock and this is the machine you agreed to buy"? It 
is in this class of cases that the question of justifiable 
reliance by the buyer on the seller's skill and judg- 
ment becomes important, and in determining whether 
the buyer justifiably relied on the seller's skill and 
judgment several things must be considered. 

INSPECTION AS AFFECTING IMPLIED 
WARRANTY. â€” Was the defect open to inspection 
and was there opportunity to inspect the goods? If 
there was, there is less reason to suppose that the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 279 

buyer was relying on the seller's skill and judgment 
than if the defect was latent and not open to inspec- 
tion. 

IMPLIED WARRANTY WHERE THE 
SELLER IS A MANUFACTURER.â€” What was 
the nature of the seller's business? Was he a manu- 
facturer of the goods in question? The strictest rules 
of implied warranty of quality are applied against 
manufacturers, and this is, you will see, reasonable, 
because the manufacturer ought to know about the 
goods and the buyer naturally relies on the manufac- 
turer, as knowing about the character of the goods, to 
give goods of proper quality. Therefore, unless the 
buyer pretty clearly assumes the risk himself of pick- 
ing out what is satisfactory to himself, a seller who is 
a manufacturer will be held to warrant the merchant- 
able quality of the goods which he makes and sells. 

IMPLIED V/ARRANTY WHERE THE 
SELLER IS A DEALER.â€” The next grade below a 
manufacturer is a dealer in that sort of goods. He 
cannot have the same knowledge as a manufacturer, 
but still, a dealer in goods of a particular kind is much 
more competent to judge of their quality than an or- 
dinary buyer and therefore a dealer also, unless there 
is special reason to suppose the buyer did not rely on 
his ow^n judgment, will be held to warrant that the 
goods are merchantable. 

IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR 
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.â€” Sometimes there is 
a warranty of still greater scope than a warranty of 
merchantability; that is, a warranty of fitness for a 



280 COMMERCIAL LAW 

particular purpose. A buyer agrees to buy glue of a 
manufacturer. The buyer is, as the glue manufacturer 
knows, a furniture manufacturer. The glue manu- 
facturer sells the buyer glue which is merchantable 
glue, but it not good furniture glue, as furniture glue 
must be of unusual tenacity. The seller is liable here 
under an implied warranty. He knew that furniture 
glue was wanted. He was a glue manufacturer, and 
he ought to have understood that the buyer was look- 
ing to him to furnish glue of a sort that would not 
only be salable as glue but would fulfill the purpose 
which the buyer had in mind when he made the pur- 
chase. 

KNOWN, DESCRIBED AND DEFINITE 
ARTICLES. â€” On the other hand, if the buyer orders 
what is called a known, described and definite article, 
he takes upon himself the burden of determining 
whether the thing which he buys will fulfill his pur- 
pose or not. For instance, a buyer in Missouri ordered 
of a boiler manufacturer two boilers selected from the 
catalogue of the boiler manufacturer, describing them 
by number. The boilers were good boilers, under or- 
dinary circumstances, but the amount of mud in the 
Missouri River, on the banks of which the boilers 
were to be used, was so great that they could not be 
successfully used there. The buyer had no redress 
against the seller in that case. He had taken upon 
himself to specify the particular kind of boilers he 
wanted; he got them and they were merchantable 
boilers. The only trouble was that they were not fit 
for use in the place where the buyer was intending to 



COMMERCIAL LAW 281 

use them. If the buyer had simply ordered boilers 
for a factory on the Missouri River, the result might 
well have been the other way, for that would have 
put the duty on the seller to furnish something that 
was suitable for that purpose. 

RELIANCE ON THE SELLER IS THE 
ESSENTIAL ELEMENT.~-The great thing to re- 
member throughout the whole subject is that the 
implied warranty of quality depends on the justifiable 
reliance of the buyer on the seller's skill. If the goods 
are not merchantable under circumstances where the 
buyer does rely, he can recover from the seller, even 
though the seller was not guilty of negligence. A 
warranty is not dependent on negligence of the seller. 

REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF WAR- 
RANTY. â€” One of the remedies, allowed in many but 
not all States, for breach of warranty, is to return the 
goods and demand the purchase money back; but 
that is only one remedy. Another remedy, which is 
universally allowed, is to sue for whatever damage 
the breach of warranty may have caused, and one or 
two cases will show how serious these damages may 
be. A seller sells a pair of sheep to a buyer with a 
warranty, express or implied, of their soundness. 
They have an infectious disease, and when put with 
a large flock of the buyer's sheep they infect the whole 
flock, and the damage is the loss of the whole flock. 
Another actual case was based on an implied war- 
ranty of the quality of rags sold to a paper manufac- 
turer. The rags came from Turkey and were infected 
with smallpox. They gave smallpox to the operatives 



282 COMMERCIAL LAW 

in the buyer's mill, and the mill had to be closed down, 
which caused great loss to the manufacturer. All that 
loss can be recovered from the seller of the rags, even 
though he was not negligent in bringing the result 
about. 

ONLY ORIGINAL BUYER CAN RECOVER 
ON A WARRANTY.â€” Nobody, however, can re- 
cover on a warranty except the original buyer. For 
instance, the operatives who caught smallpox could 
not sue the seller unless the seller was negligent. If 
he had been careless or negligent in disregarding 
their safety, they could sue him in an action of tort, 
though they had no contractual relation with him. 
And if the buyer resells the goods the purchaser from 
him cannot sue on a warranty given to the original 
buyer. 

EFFECT OF ACCEPTING DEFECTIVE 
GOODS. â€” Another matter that has caused consider- 
able litigation in regard to warranty and the obliga- 
tion of the seller in regard to the quality of goods, is 
the effect of acceptance by the buyer of goods which 
are offered to him. Suppose a certain quantity of 
Manila sugar is offered to one who has agreed to buy, 
and he takes from the seller that quantity of sugar, 
but finds it is not of as good quality as it ought to 
have been. The buyer subsequently objects, but the 
seller says, "You should have objected to that at the 
outset and refused to take it. Your taking it is an 
assent or acceptance of it as a fulfillment of the con- 
tract, and any right you may have had is now gone." 
It is settled law that if the defect was not observable 



COMMERCIAL LAW 283 

with reasonable care, the buyer does not lose any right 
by taking the goods, provided he gave prompt notice 
of the defect as soon as it was discovered. Further, 
even though at the time of delivery the buyer ob- 
served the defect or might have observed it, it is the 
law of most but by no means all States, that taking 
the goods does not necessarily indicate assent to re- 
ceive them as full satisfaction of the seller's obliga- 
tion. The buyer may receive the defective goods as 
full satisfaction, but the mere fact of taking them does 
not prove it. It is advisable, however, for the buyer 
as soon as he sees the defect to protest against it. He 
may in most States safely take the goods if he says in 
taking them, "These goods are defective and I do 
not take them in full satisfaction ;" or, if he does not 
discover the defect immediately on taking the goods, 
he ought to give notice as soon as he does discover 
that the goods are defective, and state that, though 
he proposes to keep them, he does so subject to a 
claim for their defective quality. 

SELLER'S RIGHTS WHERE BUYER FAILS 
TO ACCEPT GOODS.â€” Now the seller has some 
rights, also, that should be referred to. In the first 
place, if the buyer refuses to take title to the goods 
when they are tendered to him, the seller has a right 
to recover damages. The amount of damages will be 
the difference between the value of the goods which 
the seller still retains, because the buyer will not take 
them, and the contract price which was promised. If 
the goods are worth as much as the price promised 
for them, the seller's damages will be only nominal, 



284 COMMERCIAL LAW 

for he still has the goods and may sell them to some- 
body else for as good a price as was stipulated in the 
original bargain. 

SELLER MAY RECOVER PRICE WHERE 
TITLE HAS PASSED.â€” If the title to the goods has 
passed, the seller may sue for the price. This right to 
the price is secured by a lien on the goods as long as 
the seller retains possession of them. If the seller has 
parted with possession and with title, he cannot get 
the goods back except in one narrow class of cases. 

STOPPAGE IN TRANSIT.â€” If the goods are 
in the hands of a carrier, or other intermediary be- 
tween the seller and buyer, even though title passed 
on delivery to the carrier, the seller may stop the 
goods in transit if the buyer becomes insolvent before 
they are actually delivered to the buyer. The right 
is exercised by notifying the carrier to hold the goods 
for the shipper since the buyer has become insolvent. 
The right of lien and of stoppage in transit is given 
the seller to enable him to secure the price, which is 
the thing of interest to him in the contract. 

LEGAL AND EQUITABLE TITLES.â€” A 
legal title is a full right of ownership against every- 
body. The legal owner can take his goods wherever 
he finds them. An equitable title is a right to have the 
benefit of the goods or property, and, also, it fre- 
quently involves a right to have the legal title trans- 
ferred to the equitable owner, making him full legal 
owner. The peculiar feature of an equitable title, 
however, is that it is good only against the particular 
person who, as the phrase goes, is subject to the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 285 

equity, and also against any person who has acquired 
the property, either without giving value or with 
knowledge of the equity. To put the matter con- 
versely, an equitable title is not good against a pur- 
chaser for value without notice, or, in the language of 
the Negotiable Instruments Law, against a holder in 
due course. 

FRAUDULENT SALES.â€” This principle is im- 
portant in other branches of the law besides that 
governing negotiable instruments. The most com- 
mon case of equitable rights in sales arises in fraudu- 
lent sales. Where a sale is induced by fraud of the 
buyer, he gets the legal title to the goods, but the 
seller has an equitable title or right to get the goods 
back. Let us see how this works out. The buyer pro- 
cures goods by fraud and he sells them to A. Now, 
the defrauded seller cannot get the goods back from 
A if A paid value for them in good faith. If A did not 
pay value in good faith, then the defrauded seller may 
get the goods from him or anybody who stands in 
the same position. If the defrauded seller can reach 
the goods before they have left the hands of the 
fraudulent person, he may replevy them or he may 
seize them if that is possible. It is not worth while 
to go into the various kinds of fraud that may be 
practiced in the sale of goods, but there is one specific 
kind that comes up very commonly which is worth 
mentioning; that is, buying goods with an intention 
not to pay for them. Generally, in order to create a 
fraudulent sale, it is necessary that the fraudulent 
person shall have made some misrepresentation in 



286 COMMERCIAL LAW 

words, but here is a case where, though it may be said 
there is a misrepresentation, it is not put in words. It 
may be said there is a misrepresentation, for it is fair 
to say that every buyer when he buys goods not only 
promises to pay but represents that his intention is 
to pay for the goods, and perhaps that his financial 
condition is not so hopeless as to make the expecta- 
tion utterly impossible of fulfillment. If the situation 
actually was that the buyer either had a positive in- 
tention not to pay, or was so hopelessly insolvent that 
any reasonable person would know he could not pay 
for the goods, the transaction is fraudulent ; the seller 
still retains an equity, and may reclaim the goods from 
the buyer who has acquired a legal title or from any 
other person except a bona fide purchaser. (A draft 
of a statute to punish the making or use of false state- 
ments to obtain property or credit, jointly prepared 
by the General Counsel of the American Bankers As- 
sociation and Counsel for the National Association of 
Credit Men, has been enacted in the form recom- 
mended, or with more or less modification, in a ma- 
jority of the States. This statute provides, in sub- 
stance, that "any person who shall knowingly make 
or cause to be made any false statement in writing, 
with intent that it shall be relied upon, respecting the 
financial condition, or means or ability to pay, of him- 
self, or any other person, for the purpose of procuring 
in any form whatsoever, either the delivery of per- 
sonal property, payment of cash, making of a loan, 
extension of credit, etc., for the benefit of either 
himself or of such other person, shall be guilty 



COMMERCIAL LAW 287 

of a felony, and punishable, etc.") This question 
often arises in bankruptcy: Suppose the buyer goes 
bankrupt and the goods come into the hands of the 
buyer's trustee in bankruptcy. The trustee in bank- 
ruptcy is in legal effect, in such a case, the same per- 
son as the bankrupt; he is not a bona fide purchaser 
from him, and thus the seller may reclaim the goods 
from the trustee in bankruptcy just as he might from 
the bankrupt. In the case supposed the seller has been 
fraudulently induced to part with his title and may 
reclaim it. A case may be supposed, however, where 
the seller fraudulently retains his title, and here the 
buyer's creditors may seize the goods as if the title 
were in the buyer. Thus it is a fraud to make a con- 
ditional sale of goods to a person who intends, and 
who is understood to intend, to sell the goods again. 
The reason why it is a fraud is because it is inconsis- 
tent on the part of the wholesaler to say, "I retain 
title to the goods until paid for, yet I give them to 
you, knowing that you are going to put them in your 
stock of trade." 

DESTRUCTION OF GOODS SOLD.â€” The 
question sometimes arises as to the effect of the de- 
struction of the goods sold or contracted to be sold. 
The Sales Act in Sections 7 and 8 governs this : 

Section 7. (1) Where the parties purport to sell 
specific goods, and the goods without the knowledge 
of the seller have wholly perished at the time when the 
agreement is made, the agreement is void. 

(2) Where the parties purport to sell specific 
goods, and the goods without the knowledge of the 



288 COMMERCIAL LAW 

seller have perished in part or have wholly or in a 
material part so deteriorated in quality as to be sub- 
stantially changed in character, the buyer may at his 
option treat the sale: 

(a) As avoided, or 

(b) As transferring the property in all of the 
existing goods or in so much thereof as have not de- 
teriorated, and as binding the buyer to pay the full 
agreed price if the sale was indivisible, or to pay the 
agreed price for the goods in which the property 
passes if the sale was divisible. 

Sec. 8(1) Where there is a contract to sell specific 
goods, and subsequently, but before the risk passes 
to the buyer, without any fault on the part of the 
seller or the buyer, the goods wholly perish, the con- 
tract is thereby avoided. 

(2) Where there is a contract to sell specific 
goods, and subsequently, but before the risk passes 
to the buyer, without any fault of the seller or the 
buyer, part of the goods perish or the whole or a mate- 
rial part of the goods so deteriorate in quality as to 
be substantially changed in character, the buyer may, 
at his option treat the contract: 

(a) As avoided, or 

(b) As binding the seller to transfer the prop- 
erty in all of the existing goods or in so much thereof 
as have not deteriorated, and as binding the buyer to 
pay the full agreed price if the contract was indi- 
visible, or to pay the agreed price for so much of the 
goods as the seller, by the buyer's option, is bound to 
transfer if the contract is divisible. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 289 

CONDITIONAL SALES. â€” Certain transac- 
tions in which personal property is held as security, 
which are somewhat analogous to mortgages and 
which are very common, may now be referred to. 
They may be classed thus : Conditional sales, consign- 
ments, leases and chattel mortgages. A conditional 
sale, as that term is commonly used, is a transfer of 
the possession of personal property under an agree- 
ment to sell, the seller expressly retaining the title. 
Here we have possession and title divided. If it were 
not for the express agreement that title should remain 
in the seller, the delivery of the goods to the buyer, 
with his agreement to pay for them, would indicate a 
transfer of title to the buyer. The purpose of the 
seller in making a conditional sale is to retain security 
for the price which the buyer cannot pay all at once. 
Conditional sales are most common in regard to fur- 
niture and machinery of various kinds. Creditors of 
the buyer naturally suppose that the goods in his pos- 
session are his, and it is to avoid deception, or possible 
deception, that most States require that the condi- 
tional sale be recorded, so that creditors and every- 
body else may have notice that, although the buyer 
seems to be owner of this property, he is not so in 
reality. But, in Massachusetts, record is not required, 
and conditional sales, other than those of household 
furniture, need not even be in writing. The seller is 
secured by this sort of bargain in several ways. If 
the buyer does not pay the price when it is due, the 
seller may take the goods back. They are his goods 
and therefore he may reclaim them. Or the seller may 



290 COMMERCIAL LAW 

conclude that it is better to sue for the price, and may 
decide to let the buyer keep the goods and himself 
collect a judgment for the price by levying on any 
property the buyer may have, including that v^^hich 
was conditionally bought. Even though the buyer 
has paid a large part of the price of the goods, the 
seller may, nevertheless, reclaim the goods. The 
seller's course will be dictated largely by how much 
of the price has been paid. If a large part has been 
paid, the seller will very likely prefer to reclaim the 
goods unless they are household furniture. Why, it 
may be asked, does a buyer enter into a conditional 
sale, which is rather a poor bargain as far as he is 
concerned? The reason, of course, is that he cannot 
pay cash and he wants the use of the goods at once, 
and the conditional sale enables him to get them. By 
statute, in some jurisdictions, the conditional buyer is 
protected after he has paid a considerable portion of 
the price; either by extending the time within which 
he may pay the balance due, or by requiring a sale of 
the goods and the return to the buyer of any surplus. 
CONSIGNMENT. â€” How does a consignment 
differ from a conditional sale? When goods are sent 
or consigned it means that the person to whom they 
are sent is agent for the person who sends them. 
The consignment is like the conditional sale in this 
respect, that the person who has possession of the 
goods has not the title. The consignment differs 
vitally from a conditional sale in this respect, how- 
ever, that the consignee is not a debtor for the price. 
If the consignee sells the goods, then he, of course, 



COMMERCIAL LAW 291 

must turn over the price to the consignor less such 
commission as he takes, or if the transaction was not 
on commission, then the consignee must pay to the 
consignor the price it was bargained the consignor 
should receive. But until the goods are resold they 
remain the consignor's and at his risk. If goods con- 
ditionally sold are destroyed, the conditional buyer 
must, nevertheless, pay for them. They are at his risk 
and he is an absolute debtor for the price; but the 
consignee merely holds the goods as agent until a 
purchase takes place. 

LEASES OF CHATTELS.â€” Sometimes goods 
are leased. Here, again, we have the same point of 
similarity, that the person who has possession of the 
goods is not the owner. The lessee, like a consignee, 
is not a debtor for the price; he is a debtor for rent, 
but he is not a debtor for the price of the goods. Often 
leases contain an option to purchase, and a lease with 
an option to purchase is used by piano dealers and 
others as an alternative mode of dealing with custom- 
ers unable to pay cash, instead of a conditional sale; 
but it is not the same thing, for if a piano were de- 
stroyed without fault of either party after it had been 
leased with an option to purchase, the loss would be 
on the seller. If the option to pay had been exercised, 
of course, the loss would be on the buyer. 

CHATTEL MORTGAGES. â€” The goods are 
here owned originally by the mortgagor, and they 
ordinarily remain in his possession after he has trans- 
ferred them by the mortgage. The fundamental prin- 
ciples governing chattel mortgages are the same as 



292 COMMERCIAL LAW 

those which govern mortgages of real estate. Chattel 
mortgages must be in writing and recorded, or the 
mortgaged property must be delivered to the mort- 
gagee; otherwise they are invalid against the cred- 
itors or trustee in bankruptcy of the mortgagor ; that 
is, one may mortgage his chattels, either by delivering 
them to the mortgagee or by making a writing and 
having that recorded. Even without record or de- 
livery it is good between the parties, but it is not 
good in case of bankruptcy against the trustee in 
bankruptcy of the mortgagor, nor is it good against 
attaching creditors if there is no bankruptcy. 

MORTGAGES OF FUTURE GOODS.â€” An 
agreement is sometimes made to make a mortgage of 
goods which do not at the time exist, or are not at 
the time defined. This is especially common in regard 
to a stock of goods. A wants to borrow money on his 
stock of goods in his shop. His stock may be worth 
$25,000 and A has not capital enough to get along 
without mortgaging it. Of course, he can mortgage 
the existing stock of goods without difficulty, but the 
trouble is he wants to keep on doing business, and sell 
in regular course of business the mortgaged stock of 
goods. That, too, would be easy enough if the mort- 
gagee were willing to agree to it, but the mortgagee 
is not willing to agree unless equal security is substi- 
tuted for any goods that are sold. What they would 
like to provide is that the mortgagor shall have power 
to sell the existing goods if he chooses in the ordinary 
course of business, provided he always keeps a stock 
of goods on hand equal to that on hand at the time the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 293 

mortgage was made, the idea being that as one thing 
is released from the lien of the mortgage other things, 
of at least equal value, shall replace it. It is not an 
unreasonable transaction, from a business standpoint, 
but the law generally does not allow it validity except 
to this extent. It is valid as between the parties so 
far as to give the mortgagee a power at any time to 
take possession, and when he does take possession the 
mortgage is valid as to the goods of which he takes 
possession against creditors or anybody else. The 
mortgagee may thus take possession right up to the 
time of the mortgagor's bankruptcy, or at any time 
prior to actual seizure of the stock of goods on an 
attachment. This gives the mortgagee some security 
if the mortgagor will be good enough to give the 
mortgagee a hint when it is wise for the mortgagee to 
take possession, because, as the mortgagee can take 
possession just before bankruptcy or just before an 
attachment, the mortgagee will be protected. But, of 
course, there is a chance that the mortgagee may not 
get the goods, and therefore this form of security, in 
most States, is not now advised, although it has been 
much attempted in the past. In some States, however, 
such a mortgage gives a right against goods after- 
wards acquired, which is superior to that of attaching 
creditors or of a trustee in bankruptcy, even though 
the mortgagee does not take possession. 

GIFTS. â€” A gift is the immediate voluntary 
transfer of personal property. To make a valid gift, 
therefore, it must be voluntary, gratuitous, and ab- 
solute. As has been explained, a gift is distinguished 



294 COMMERCIAL LAW 

from a sale or a contract to sell by the fact that it is 
gratuitous. Gifts are usually divided into two classes: 
gifts "inter vivos" and gifts "causa mortis." There 
is no distinction between these two kinds of gifts, so 
far as the necessity of the intent to deliver title and 
delivery of the property are concerned, but the dis- 
tinction lies in the fact that in gifts "causa mortis," 
the change in title is defeasible upon certain condi- 
tions. The ordinary gift "inter vivos," "between liv- 
ing people" is irrevocable when completed. The gift 
"causa mortis," that is, one made by a person in im- 
mediate apprehension of death, is always subject to 
the condition that if the person recovers, the title to 
the property, which he has given away, reverts to 
him. For A, who is in his last illness, to say to B, 
who is sitting near his bedside, "I wish you to have 
my gold watch when I am gone, but my brother is 
wearing it now in Europe" would not be a gift "causa 
mortis." There is no delivery. It would not pass 
title, upon his death, to his friend because in order to 
dispose of property after one is dead, a will is neces- 
sary. Even between the parties gifts are invalid un- 
less accompanied by delivery, or made by deed under 
seal. The transaction without delivery or deed is, 
in effect, a promise to give, and there being no consid- 
eration the promisor may subsequently refuse to keep 
his promise. If a savings-bank book, a bond, a stock 
certificate, a life-insurance policy, a note or check of 
a third person (but not one made by the giver), or 
any chattel property is delivered to the donee, the 
gift is binding and irrevocable; but otherwise the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 295 

donee gets absolutely nothing and the donor's ex- 
ecutor is entitled to the property attempted to be dis- 
posed of by gift, and must treat it as part of the assets 
of the estate. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” A recent case in New Jer- 
sey shows clearly the effects of the application of the 
rules just described. In Bailey v. Orange Memorial 
Hospital, 102 Atl. 7, the facts were that the testatrix 
died about June 10, 1893, leaving a will, which had 
been duly probated, and under which the complain- 
ants had qualified as executors. Among the papers, 
which the executors found in the testatrix's safe de- 
posit box after her death, was a certificate made in her 
name for fifty shares of the capital stock of the United 
N. J. Railroad and Canal Co., bearing the following 
indorsement, "For value received I hereby assign and 
transfer unto the Orange Memorial Hospital fi.fty 
shares of the capital stock represented by the within 
certificate and do hereby irrevocably constitute and 

appoint attorney to transfer the said 

stock on the books of the within named corporation 
with full power of substitution in the premises. 

Mary Campfield. 
"Dated Oct. 28, 1911. 
"Witnessed by James C. MacDonald." 
In the same envelope containing this certificate the 
executors also found the following letter in the hand- 
writing of Mrs. Campfield: "To my executors: The 
accompanying certificate of fifty shares of the United, 
etc. Co. is my gift to the Orange Memorial Hospital 
for a bed to be called the 'Mahlon Campfield Bed.' The 



296 COMMERCIAL LAW 

stock has been retained since its date of transfer be- 
cause I desire to be benefited by the dividends there- 
on as long as I live. 

Mary Campfield. 
"Dated Oct. 28, 1911." 

In this box Mrs. Campfield kept her bonds and 
mortgages, stock certificates, and other valuable 
papers relating to her own property and to the estate 
of her husband, of which she was executrix. There 
were two sets of keys to the box, one of which was in 
Mrs. Campfield's possession, and the other in the 
possession of one of her executors, who assisted her 
for some time in the management of her affairs. 
Shortly before the indorsement on the certificate was 
made, and the letter written, Mrs. Campfield re- 
quested Mr. Everett, the executor, to take the stock 
certificate from her box and deliver it to her attorney, 
stating that she would let her attorney know in a few 
days what to do about it. A few days later the attor- 
ney handed Mr. Everett an envelope containing the 
stock certificate, and told him there was a letter with 
it. Mr. Everett saw the certificate but did not see 
the letter, and he placed the envelope containing the 
certificate in the safe deposit box. The attorney had 
sealed the envelope after showing him the certificate. 
After Mr. Everett had told Mrs. Campfield what had 
been done, she said, "Well, that is for the hospital 
and that settles it," and she added: "It is in an en- 
velope, as you probably saw, and addressed to my 
executors, and they will find a letter inside telling 
them what to do with it." After this, Mrs. Campfield 



COMMERCIAL LAW 297 

continued to receive the dividends paid on these 
shares, and there is some evidence to indicate that she 
had access to the safe deposit box and examined its 
contents during the winter preceding her death. The 
court, in its opinion, said: "I do not think there can 
be any doubt of Mrs. Campfield's donative intention 
regarding these shares of stock, and it is equally 
clear that she never consummated that intention to 
make the gift, by the actual delivery of the stock to 
the hospital, or to any one as trustee for it; and it 
also appears that she intended the gift should be 
effective only after her death. She expressly retained 
the ownership and dominion over the stock for the 
purpose, at least, of collecting and enjoying the divi- 
dends paid thereon. * * * The gift of the stock not 
having been completed by delivery, or by the relin- 
quishment of control over the certificate representing 
it, the stock must be declared to be an asset of the 
estate." 



CHAPTER IX 



Real Property 



DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LAW 
GOVERNING SALES OF REAL AND 
PERSONAL PROPERTY.â€” The main dis- 
tinction between the law governing real and personal 
property is the increased formality necessary in trans- 
actions governing real estate. Contracts for the sale 
of real estate must be in writing and actual convey- 
ances of an interest in land must not only be in writ- 
ing, but, except where seals have been abolished by 
statute, must be executed under seal. In order to 
make the transaction valid against third persons, rec- 
ord in the Registry of Deeds in the county where the 
land is situated is also requisite. Unless a contract 
for the sale of real estate is recorded, a subsequent 
conveyance to a purchaser, for value and without 
notice, will destroy the right of the buyer under the 
first contract to get the land, though he will still have 
an action for damages against the seller. So, in many 
jurisdictions, creditors of the man contracting to sell 
may by attaching the land as the seller's property 
satisfy their claims from it to the detriment of the 
buyer's right. Therefore, an actual conveyance of 
real estate must be recorded in order to protect the 
grantee. As a pre-requisite for record it is generally 
required that contracts and deeds of real estate shall 
be acknowledged before a notary public or other 
official authorized by law. 

298 



COMMERCIAL LAW 299 

DUTIES OF BUYER AND SELLER UNDER 
CONTRACT TO CONVEY REAL ESTATE.â€” 
The primary duty of the seller in a contract to con- 
vey real estate is to transfer a good title. It is im- 
portant for the buyer to determine before the time for 
performance whether the seller's title is good in order 
to determine whether he himself will accept the deed 
and pay the price. Accordingly, the buyer has* the title 
examined by search in the Registry of Deeds. If the 
search discloses that the seller's title is defective the 
buyer does not on that account necessarily have a 
right to rescind the contract. The defect of title may 
be removed before the time of performance, and if the 
nature of the defect is such that this is possible, the 
buyer can only give notice of the defect and request 
its removal. If the title of the seller is so defective 
that it cannot be cured, or if the seller manifests by 
his conduct an intent to repudiate the contract, as by 
selling the land to another, the buyer need not wait 
for the time for performance, but may at once give 
notice that he rescinds the contract. Unless the 
seller has expressly contracted to convey by warranty 
deed, his obligation is generally satisfied by a quit 
claim deed. It is well, therefore, for a purchaser, 
when he contracts to purchase a piece of real property, 
to insert in the contract a clause to the effect that the 
seller agrees to convey by a sufficient warranty deed. 
The seller is also bound not to commit waste on 
the premises between the time of the contract and 
the time of performance. The rule in regard to 
accidental injury is stated hereafter, but as to in- 



300 COMMERCIAL LAW 

tentional or negligent injury of the premises, the 
law is clear that such an injury is a breach of duty by 
the seller. The buyer's duty is to pay the price ac- 
cording to the terms of the contract. The obligations 
of the seller to convey, and of the buyer to buy, are 
concurrent, unless the contract expressly provides the 
contrary ; that is, the buyer in order to acquire a right 
against the seller must tender payment, as he de- 
mands a deed; and the seller in order to acquire a 
right against the buyer must tender a proper deed 
when demanding payment. The obligation of either 
party to tender may, however, be excused by circum- 
stances showing that tender would be useless. Thus, 
if the buyer is insolvent, the seller need not tender a 
deed, and if the buyer has repudiated the contract or 
committed waste to a material extent, or conveyed 
the premises to a third person, the buyer need not 
tender payment, in order to acquire a right of action. 
But if there is any doubt at all, the purchaser or the 
seller, as the case may be, should make a tender, so as 
to preserve his legal rights. 

DOWER AND CURTESY.â€” By the common 
law a wife on her marriage acquired a right in her 
husband's land, which, though not vesting until his 
death, encumbered the title immediately. On his 
death she became entitled to a life estate in a one- 
third interest of all the lands of which he had been 
possessed since the date of their marriage. Accord- 
ingly, where the common law rule of dower still pre- 
vails, a husband cannot give an unencumbered title 
to real estate unless his wife joins in the conveyance. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 301 

Similarly a husband was entitled at common law to a 
life interest in the lands of his deceased wife if they 
had had a child born alive. This was called the estate 
by curtesy. Its extent, it will be observed, is not the 
same as that of dower. The husband's life interest 
extended to all the lands of the wife, but on the other 
hand, it did not arise at all unless there was a child 
born alive; whereas the wife's dower right arose im- 
mediately on marriage. The rules of dower and 
curtesy have been changed by statute to a greater or 
less extent in most States, but it is still almost uni- 
versally important that a wife should join in her hus- 
band's conveyance of real estate, and that a husband 
should join in a wife's conveyance of her real estate. 

DEFAULT IN PERFORMANCE.â€” The law 
regards more leniently a default in time in carrying 
out contracts for the sale of real estate than it does a 
similar default in the sale of personal property. In 
sales of personal property, especially if it is of a char- 
acter which rapidly fluctuates in value, time is said 
to be "of the essence;" that is, the failure of either 
party to perform at or about the agreed day is fatal 
to his rights to enforce the contract ; but in the case of 
real estate it is generally held that time is not of the 
essence of the contract unless it is either expressly so 
provided in the contract, or the circumstances of the 
case are such as to show that time was a matter of 
vital importance. 

DESTRUCTION OF PREMISES.â€” Where 
personal property, which the owner has contracted to 
sell, is destroyed, the loss is the seller's provided the 



302 COMMERCIAL LAW 

title is still in him, and the buyer has committed no 
default; but in most jurisdictions, if real estate is 
similarly destroyed, the buyer must nevertheless pay 
the price. In the absence of special provisions in a 
contract of sale, if a house on the premises sold has 
burned between the time of the contract and the time 
for its performance, without fault of the seller, the 
seller can compel the buyer to accept a deed of the 
land without the house and pay the full price. This 
rule has been much criticized, and it is not universally 
in force; for example, it is not the law of Massachu- 
setts. In some other States the loss will not fall upon 
the buyer unless possession of the premises has been 
delivered to him under the contract, but in New York, 
and probably a majority of the States, even though 
the seller still has possession, as well as title, the risk 
of accidental loss rests upon the buyer. Where risk 
of destruction of the premises is thrown on the buyer, 
immediately after he has made a contract to purchase, 
it is of obvious importance that he should immediately 
insure the premises. The insurance of the seller, un- 
less transferred to the buyer at that time with the 
company's assent, will not protect the buyer. Insur- 
ance is a contract of personal indemnity, and the sell- 
er's insurance only protects the seller's interest. The 
result is that if the premises are destroyed, the insur- 
ance company will not be obliged to pay the seller his 
insurance, since the seller, under the contract of sale, 
can recover from the buyer ; and even if the insurance 
were paid to the seller, the buyer could not claim the 
benefit of it. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 303 

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE,â€” In addition to 
the ordinary remedy for a breach of contract, namely 
an action at law for damages, another remedy, that of 
specific performance, is permitted in the case of con- 
tracts for the sale of land ; that is, the court will actu- 
ally compel one who has contracted to sell land to 
make a conveyance thereof on receiving the agreed 
price, and will similarly compel one who has con- 
tracted to buy to pay the agreed price on receiving a 
deed of the premises. Specific performance of such 
contracts is granted on the theory that money dam- 
ages are an inadequate remedy, and that the nature of 
the situation is such that it is possible to compel the 
actual performance of the contract. In contracts for 
the sale of personal property, damages are generally 
considered adequate, but contracts for the sale of a 
painting or a race-horse would be specifically enforced. 
Sometimes the seller is unable fully to perform his 
agreed contract. He may not be able to give a title 
free from encumbrances, or he may have committed 
waste on the premises. In such a case, though the 
buyer need not carry out the contract unless he 
wishes, he can if he chooses get a conveyance decreed 
to him and an allowance deducted from the price 
commensurate to the injury caused by the encum- 
brance or waste. Specific performance will be granted 
not only against the seller, but if the seller in viola- 
tion of his contract has conveyed the land to a third 
person who had notice of the contract or who did not 
give value in exchange for the land, the court will 
compel the grantee of the premises to convey them to 



304 COMMERCIAL LAW 

the person who had the original contract to buy. If, 
however, one who has agreed to sell the premises 
actually sells and conveys them to another who is a 
purchaser for value without notice of the prior con- 
tract, such a purchaser gets an indefeasible title, and 
the person having the prior contract to buy must re- 
sort, for his only relief, to an action for damages 
against the seller. For this reason it is important to 
record a contract to buy or sell. This record operates 
as notice to all the world, and no purchaser subse- 
quent to the record will have the rights of a pur- 
chaser for value without notice. 

VENDOR'S LIEN.â€” In some States a seller of 
land who has not been paid the price is entitled to 
what is called a vendor's lien on the land. This en- 
ables him to compel a sale of the property to satisfy 
his claim for the purchase money unless the land has 
been conveyed, before proceedings are brought to en- 
force the lien, to a purchaser for value without notice 
that the original vendor is still unpaid. In many 
States, however, the seller has no vendor's lien and 
must take a mortgage back for any unpaid portion of 
the purchase price if he desires security for its pay- 
ment. 

DEFINITION OF MORTGAGE.â€” A mort- 
gage is a transfer of property to a creditor to secure a 
debt. Unless there is a debt there can be no mortgage, 
and the original idea of a mortgage, still preserved in 
the forms of conveyance in many States, is that the 
mortgagor or debtor transfers the title to the mort- 
gagee or creditor. In popular understanding the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 305 

mortgagor owns the mortgaged premises but the 
mortgagee will take or sell them if the debt is in de- 
fault. The theory of the common law, however, was 
that the mortgagee became the owner of the premises 
as soon as the mortgage was made, but that the 
mortgagor was entitled to re-acquire the ownership 
by payment of the debt at maturity. Indeed, early 
mortgages were often made by two separate instru- 
ments: (1) an absolute deed of conveyance to the 
mortgagee, and (2) an instrument called a defeasance 
which provided that on payment of the amount of the 
debt, on a given day, the property should revest in the 
mortgagor. 

MODERN AMERICAN MORTGAGES.â€” At 
the present day in many jurisdictions a mortgage still 
remains, both in the form of the instrument and in the 
legal conception of the rights of the parties funda- 
mentally, the same as under the early doctrines just 
outlined. In other jurisdictions, of which New York 
may be taken as a typical State, the theory is no 
longer that the mortgagee has title to the property, 
but that he has only a lien on it, which he may enforce 
if the debt is not paid. The difference in actual re- 
sults under the two theories, however, is less than 
might be supposed. Where the mortgagee is still re- 
garded as having the title, his power to make use of 
that title is limited so that he can only make use of it 
for the purpose of securing payment of what is due 
him. On the other hand where the mortgagee is re- 
garded as having only a lien, the lien is a legal right 
against the real estate which enables the creditor to 



306 COMMERCIAL LAW 

enforce his claim against it in practically the same 
way which he would do were he the owner of the real 
estate. 

COVENANTS AND STIPULATIONS.â€”A 
mortgage of real estate ordinarily contains the same 
covenants of warranty as a warranty deed of real 
estate. Where a mortgage still has its common law 
effect of transferring title to the mortgagee, it is es- 
sential that the mortgage should contain a provision 
that until default the mortgagor shall be entitled to 
the possession of the premises. Covenants in regard 
to the payment of taxes by the mortgagor and the 
keeping of the premises insured for a certain amount, 
are usual and important provisions. There is also 
commonly contained in a mortgage a power of sale; 
that is an authority or agency given to the mortgagee 
to sell the premises free of the mortgagor's right of 
redemption in case default of payment is made, or in 
case such default continues for a certain specified 
time. In all States printed forms of mortgages are 
ordinarily used. These forms are prepared with care 
to suit the requirements of local law; and if you are 
sure that the printed form is prepared and sold for 
use in the State where the mortgaged land is situated, 
you may feel satisfied that the terms of the instrument 
are suitable to protect the rights of both parties. 

EXECUTION AND RECORD OF MORT- 
GAGE. â€” A mortgage of real estate must everywhere 
be executed with the same formality that is necessary 
for an ordinary deed of conveyance. Different forms 
are in use in different States, and it is always desirable 



COMMERCIAL LAW 307 

to use the form of mortgage customary in the State 
where the land lies. It is important to ascertain 
whether a seal is necessary in that State, and the in- 
strument must ordinarily be acknowledged before a 
notary public having a seal, or before a commissioner 
of deeds for the State in which the land lies. There 
is in every State a recording act by virtue of which 
unrecorded mortgages are made invalid against subse- 
quent purchasers and sometimes against attaching 
creditors. Though an unrecorded mortgage is, as be- 
tween the parties, as effective as if recorded, it is of 
vital importance promptly to record every mortgage 
in the Registry of Deeds in the county where the land 
lies. 

SPECIAL CASES.â€” Where a mortgage is ex- 
ecuted by an agent or by a corporation, it is essential 
that the agent or corporate officer have authority to 
act. In the case of a corporation it is necessary both 
that the corporation have power to make the mort- 
gage in question and also that the particular officer or 
officers who attempt to exercise the power are author â–  
ied so to do. The principles here involved, however, 
are not different from those generally governing the 
acts of agents and corporations. The same may be 
said in regard to mortgages by husband or wife, by a 
partnership, or by trustees. In the case of mortgages 
executed by any such person it is necessary to take 
special precautions. A mortgage by husband or wife 
should generally be also executed by the other. A 
mortgage by a partnership should be executed in the 
same form in which the title is held by the partner- 



308 COMMERCIAL LAW 

ship, and if the title is held by less than all the part- 
ners, it is desirable that the other partners should 
express their assent to the transaction either in the 
mortgage itself, or in a separate instrument executed 
with the same formality. 

INTEREST IN PROPERTY.â€” Any kind of in- 
terest in real estate may be mortgaged and mortgages 
of property, not yet acquired by the mortgagor, have 
generally been held to attach to the property when 
acquired by the mortgagor, and then to give the mort- 
gagee as full a right as if the mortgagor had owned 
the premises at the time he purported to mortgage 
them. 

OTHER PARTICULARS.â€” The description of 
land in a mortgage should have the same exactness as 
is necessary in a deed. Unlike deeds, mortgages or- 
dinarily state their consideration and must of course 
state the indebtedness which they are given to secure. 
A mortgage may be given to secure a past debt if the 
mortgagor, when he makes the mortgage, is solvent. 
If he is then insolvent, to give such a mortgage would 
be a preference, which is an act of bankruptcy, and 
subject the mortgagor to possible bankruptcy pro- 
ceedings. If the mortgagee in such a case had reason- 
able cause to believe that the mortgagor was insolvent, 
the mortgage could also be set aside by a trustee in 
bankruptcy. 

EQUITY OF REDEMPTION.â€” By the terms 
of the mortgage the mortgagor's right is ordinarily 
made dependent on payment of the debt on a fixed day, 
or of instalments on fixed days. A day thus fixed in the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 309 

mortgage is sometimes called the "law day." Accord- 
ing to the terms of the instrument the only way in 
which the mortgagor can be revested with title to the 
property is by complying with the express terms of 
the mortgage and paying the debt on the law day. The 
result of this provision, if enforced, would be that if 
the debt is not paid exactly when it is due, the mort- 
gagee remains the absolute owner of the mortgaged 
premises. Courts of equity, however, long ago lim- 
ited the mortgagee's right, holding that the real object 
of the transaction is to secure a debt, and that if the 
mortgagee obtains his debt and interest he ought to 
be satisfied. Accordingly if the mortgagor was in de- 
fault in the payment of the debt, he was allowed to 
redeem the property by payment of the debt and in- 
terest until the time of tender. If the mortgagee re- 
fused to accept his debt and interest, the mortgagor 
could bring a suit in equity to redeem the property 
and the court would order the reconveyance to him 
of the property on payment of the debt. Because of 
this right on the part of the mortgagor, his interest 
in the property came to be called an equity of redemp- 
tion, and it is often so called at the present day. The 
position taken by courts of equity, permitting re- 
demption, might work a hardship on the mortgagee 
because he could never feel sure of his title to the 
property, however long the debt might remain un- 
paid. This difficulty was met by allowing the mort- 
gagee to bring a suit to foreclose the debtor's right of 
redemption. We speak of foreclosing a mortgage, 
but, strictly, it is the debtor's right to redeem which is 



310 COMMERCIAL LAW 

foreclosed. When such a suit of foreclosure was 
brought equity would fix a time within which the 
debtor might redeem the premises by paying the debt 
and interest, and then the decree provided that if the 
debtor failed to pay within the named period, his right 
of redemption should be forever foreclosed. At the 
present time there are in practically all jurisdictions 
statutory rules, in regard to the foreclosure of mort- 
gages, which we shall presently describe, but it is im- 
portant to remember the fundamental nature of the 
mortgage transaction, and the original remedies of re- 
demption and foreclosure. 

A RECONVEYANCE IS NOT NECESSARY 
ON PAYMENT OF THE MORTGAGE.â€” If a 
mortgage is regarded as a mere lien to secure a debt, 
it is obvious that a payment of the debt discharges the 
lien, and the title already vested in the mortgagor be- 
comes free from any incumbrance. On the theory of 
the common law, though the title passed to the mort- 
gagee, it was subject to a condition subsequent which 
would revest the title in the mortgagor if payment of 
the debt was made at maturity. By mere operation 
of law, therefore, payment of the mortgage when due 
revested title in the mortgagor without reconveyance. 
After a default, however, a subsequent payment is not 
strictly a performance of the condition upon which 
the mortgaged deed provided that title should revest. 
Accordingly a reconveyance was necessary in such a 
case at common law, but at the present day it is gen- 
erally not requisite even in case of payment after 
default. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 311 

THE MORTGAGOR IS LIABLE AS A 
DEBTOR. â€” The mortgagor is bound as a debtor or- 
dinarily by a bond or promissory note in which he ex- 
pressly agrees to pay the amount of his debt. It is 
perfectly possible that the debt secured by the mort- 
gage should not be represented by such an instrument, 
but should rest merely in oral agreement or should 
be contained in a covenant in the mortgage deed itself, 
but it is usual and desirable to have a separate obliga- 
tion. The fact that the debtor has given the mortgage 
does not in any way limit the rights of the mortgagee 
as an ordinary creditor. He may sue on the mortgage 
debt when it is due, in the same manner as if there 
were no mortgage. It is his option whether he will 
foreclose the mortgage, as a means of collecting his 
claim, or whether he will get judgment on the debt, 
and seek to collect that judgment in the same way 
that an ordinary judgment creditor would. This rule 
is changed by statute in California, and one or two 
other States, where by statute the mortgagee is re- 
quired to realize from the mortgaged property what 
he can before seeking a personal judgment against 
the mortgagor. In many jurisdictions the creditor 
may, in a single proceeding, obtain foreclosure of the 
mortgagor's rights by sale of the property, and a per- 
sonal judgment against the mortgagor for any defi- 
ciency which the proceeds of the property may leave. 
This is called a deficiency judgment. 

RIGHTS OF MORTGAGOR AND MORT- 
GAGEE IN MORTGAGED LAND.â€” Even though 
the mortgagor is regarded by the law as having no 



312 COMMERCIAL LAW 

longer the legal title to the premises, but only an 
equity of redemption, his interest is regarded as real 
estate and descends on his death according to the 
laws governing real estate. The mortgagee's inter- 
est, on the other hand, is regarded as personal prop- 
erty since the debt which the mortgagee is intended 
to secure is personal property, and even a legal title 
to the real estate held by the mortgagee is held merely 
for security, and is an incident to the debt. So the 
mortgagor's interest in mortgaged property is sub- 
ject to be seized on execution by his creditors while 
the mortgagee's interest can not be so seized. The 
mortgagee's creditors must reach his interest by 
means appropriate to realize upon the debt, not upon 
the land. The mortgagor's interest being regarded 
as real estate will give rise to the same estates of 
dower in favor of the wife of the deceased mortgagor 
or curtesy in favor of the husband of a deceased mort- 
gagor, as are allowed by the law in the case of real 
estate generally. The mortgagor may, while in pos- 
session, deal with the property in any way in which an 
owner may, except that he will not be permitted to 
imperil the mortgagee's security by any kind of waste. 
The mortgagor may, subject to the mortgage, lease, 
sell or devise it. He may collect the rents and profits 
and use them as his so long as he is in possession. 
Where, however, the mortgagee is regarded as hav- 
ing the legal title to the premises, he may eject the 
mortgagor at any time from possession, even though 
the mortgage is not due, unless prohibited by statute 
or by the express terms of the mortgage deed. In 



COMMERCIAL LAW 313 

fact he usually is so prohibited. Even when not so 
prohibited, it is not always well for a mortgagee to 
take possession because, if he does so, he is bound to 
account not only for all profits actually received from 
the premises, but also for all that might have been 
received. He becomes liable for any waste of the 
premises or any failure to deal with them in a reason- 
ably prudent manner. 

SALE BY MORTGAGEE OR MORTGAGOR 
OF REAL ESTATE.â€” Either the mortgagee or the 
mortgagor may assign his interest. The mortgagee 
in assigning his interest is in legal contemplation do- 
ing two things: (1) assigning the debt; (2) assigning 
the title or lien which he holds on the mortgagor's 
real estate as security for the debt. As to the assign- 
ment of the debt, the matter is governed by the same 
principles as govern the assignment of choses in ac- 
tion generally. That is, if the mortgaged debt is 
represented by a negotiable instrument, the instru- 
ment may be negotiated to the purchaser in the or- 
dinary way, and with the ordinary effects of such in- 
struments. If the mortgaged debt is not represented 
by a negotiable instrument, the assignment of the 
debt is an assignment of a chose in action. Where 
the common law view of mortgage still prevails, that 
the mortgagee has the legal title, he can only trans- 
fer it to an assignee by a deed executed with the same 
formalities necessary for the transfers of real estate. 
As, however, the law recognizes that it is the debt 
which is the essential feature of the relation between 
mortgagor and mortgagee, and that the mortgaged 



314 COMMERCIAL LAW 

estate is held merely as security for a debt, a valid 
assignment of the debt is held to make the assignee 
equitably entitled to the mortgaged property as secu- 
rity. And, in effect, one who obtains the mortgage 
debt will secure the benefit of the mortgaged property 
even though the local law regards a mortgagee as 
having the legal title. Where the mortgagee is re- 
garded as having m.erely a lien, the assignment of the 
debt involves a transfer of the lien. 

INCIDENTS TO MORTGAGE.â€” If the mort- 
gagor wishes to convey his interest, he transfers the 
estate by deed exactly as if it were unmortgaged, ex- 
cept that the conveyance is stated to be subject to a 
specified mortgage, and it is sometimes added "which 
the grantee assum.es and agrees to pay." It is desir- 
able for the seller that the grantee shall assume and 
agree to pay the mortgage while it is desirable for the 
buyer that he shall buy the premises merely subject to 
the mortgage without assuming it. The difference 
between the two transactions is this : In either event 
the grantee receives the premises burdened by a mort- 
gage, the amount of which will be deducted from the 
consideration paid as the agreed value of the premises. 
In either event, if the debt is unpaid, the mortgagee 
will foreclose and the grantee will lose the premises. 
In order to save the premises, the grantee will have 
to pay the mortgage. 

ASSUMPTION OF MORTGAGE.â€” The dis- 
tinction is only seriously important when the mort- 
gaged premises are worth less than the amount of the 
mortgage. In that event the mortgagee will be entitled 



COMMERCIAL LAW 315 

to a deficiency judgment against the mortgagor. The 
mortgagor was the original debtor and cannot escape 
from his obligation to the mortgagee without the lat- 
ter's assent. If the mortgagor is forced to pay, he 
cannot recover the amount from his grantee unless the 
latter assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage. If, 
however, the grantee did make such assumption, he 
will ultimately have to pay the deficiency. If the mort- 
gagee, without foreclosing the property, should sue 
the mortgagor directly on the debt, the latter would 
be compelled to pay. Even if the sale to the mort- 
gagor's grantee had been made merely subject to the 
mortgage, the mortgagor on paying the debt would 
be subrogated to the mortgage and would himself be 
enabled to foreclose the property. But if the property 
failed to realize enough to reimburse him for the pay- 
ment of the debt, he would lose this deficiency unless 
the grantee had assumed and agreed to pay the mort- 
gage. Whether the mortgagee may sue directly a 
grantee of mortgaged premises who has assumed and 
agreed to pay the mortgage, is a question which has 
been much litigated ; but it is now held almost every- 
where that the mortgagee may do so. Sometimes a 
succession of grantees, each in turn on buying the 
premises, assumes and agrees to pay a certain mort- 
gage. The mortgagee, in such a case, is generally al- 
lowed to recover from any one of these grantees so 
far as is necessary to satisfy his claim; but the ulti- 
mate liability will rest upon the last purchaser who 
has assumed the debt. As against a grantee who has 
not assumed the debt, the mortgagee has no rights. 



316 COMMERCIAL LAW 

He can deprive such a purchaser of his land, so far as 
is necessary to collect the debt, but he cannot hold him 
personally liable. 

FORECLOSURE OF REAL ESTATE MORT- 
GAGES. â€” According to the original theory of the 
law, the mortgagee became the absolute owner of 
the mortgaged premises by the failure of the mort- 
gagor to pay the debt when due, and by the foreclo- 
sure or termination of the mortgagor's right of re- 
demption. Foreclosure of this character is still possible 
in a few States, but in most States it has been wholly 
abolished, and everywhere the ordinary method of 
foreclosure is by sale of the mortgaged property. Fre- 
quently the sale is made by virtue of an authority or 
power of sale given in the mortgage itself, but some- 
times it is made under authority of a decree of court 
in foreclosure proceedings. Where a mortgage con- 
tains a power to the mortgagee to sell on default of 
the mortgagor, he is acting not simply on his own 
behalf but as agent for the mortgagor in transferring 
title to the property. The proceeds will be applied 
first to the payment of the debt with interest and the 
expenses of the sale. Any surplus will be held by the 
mortgagee in trust for the mortgagor and must be 
paid over to the latter. The situation is entirely an- 
alogous to that created by a collateral note where 
stock or other personal property is transferred as col- 
lateral to secure a debt. The statutes of all States 
contain regulations in regard to the foreclosure of 
mortgages, which must be observed. They are aimed 
generally to protect the mortgagor from forfeiture of 



COMMERCIAL LAW 317 

his property to any greater extent than is necessary 
to insure the payment of the mortgage debt. In any 
case of foreclosure the local statute and practice must 
be consulted. 

DEEDS OF TRUST.â€” In some States what are 
called deeds of trust have been largely substituted for 
mortgages. The temptation to make such a substitu- 
tion is greatest in jurisdictions which refuse to recog- 
nize the mortgagee as the legal owner of the premises. 
If the law denies the mortgagee this recognition, he 
can, by insisting, as a condition of his loan, that the 
premises shall be conveyed to a third person as 
trustee, achieve the result that the mortgagor at least 
is no longer the legal owner of the premises. Essen- 
tially the situation is the same under a deed of trust as 
under a common law mortgage. In both cases the 
legal title is held merely to secure the debt, and the 
court will secure to the debtor all the value of the 
property which can be realized from its sale over and 
above the amount of the debt. If the debt is paid of 
course the debtor is entitled to the return of the se- 
curity whether it is real estate or personalty, and 
whether held directly by the creditor or by a third 
person as trustee. 

THE TORRENS LAW.â€” The Torrens system 
of registration of land titles received its name from 
Sir Robert Torrens who drew the first Torrens law 
enacted in South Australia in 1858. The practice of 
searching titles has gone through this development. 
In country districts the person purchasing real estate 
frequently accepted the grantor's deed without any 



318 COMMERCIAL LAW 

search of the title. Of course, if there were judgments 
against the grantor, or other claims against the real 
property, the purchaser or the grantee takes the prop- 
erty subject to these claims. Ordinarily, however, 
the careful purchaser employs a lawyer to make a 
search of the title before he accepts it and pays the 
purchase price. In New York City to-day, and in 
some of the other large cities of the country, most of 
the title searching has passed out of the hands of the 
lawyers into the hands of the title companies. The 
title company makes the search now, the same as the 
lawyer formerly did, with an added advantage. Sup- 
pose I am to buy Blackacre, and employ attorney 
Blackstone to search the title. He reports it as being 
free and clear. I take possession and pay the purchase 
price. Six months later the wife of the grantor ap- 
pears on the scene. When the grantor conveyed, he 
stated in the deed that he v/as single. The wife es- 
tablishes the validity of her marriage, and her hus- 
band's, my grantor's, death. She is, of course, entitled 
to dower. I am obliged to make some kind of settle- 
ment with her, and there is no way, probably, by 
which I can hold my lawyer for failing to find that the 
grantor v/as married, when he made the search for 
me. If the title to my property had been searched 
for me by a title company, it would have issued a title 
insurance policy in my name which would have pro- 
tected me, in this instance, and I would have been re- 
imbursed by the title company for the loss which I 
sustained in having to pay the dower claim of my 
grantor's wife. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 319 

ECONOMY OF TITLE SEARCHES.â€” Econ- 
omically, the title company is a big step in advance 
of the former practice of having lawyers make a 
search. The title company can do it much cheaper. 
If Blackacre was sold, when lawyers alone were mak- 
ing searches, probably a different lawyer v/ould be 
employed at each sale, and he would make a search 
back to the earliest deed. After a title company has 
made its search, the result is in its records and the 
next time it is on the same piece of property, the 
search would simply be what is called a continuation, 
which would carry the search from the last time the 
company was on the title down to the present time. 
This enables the title company to make its fee more 
reasonable than the lawyer, and v/e can now secure a 
title company's search and insurance policy fre- 
quently for less than formerly was paid to the lawyer 
for the search alone. 

ESCHEAT. â€” However, the policies issued by 
the title companies are not absolutely satisfactory, 
and the next, and perhaps final, step is for the State to 
come in and guarantee the title. This is perfectly 
logical. The ownership of all land is in the State, 
theoretically, the same as under the English common 
law. The King, in those days, owned all the land. 
This is more than theory, even to-day. If a man dies, 
leaving no heirs and no will, his real property escheats 
to the State, this being based simply on the theory 
that the property goes back to its original owner, the 
State. If this is true, why should not the State insure 
the title? This is the theory of the Torrens' system. 



320 COMMERCIAL LAW 

EFFECT OF TORRENS LAW.â€” The first 
Torrens law, enacted in this country, was in Illinois, 
and similar acts have been passed in a number of the 
States, including New York. When such laws are on 
the statute books, generally the business of a title 
company will be legislated out of existence. For that 
reason, opposition to the passage of such laws has 
developed in some States. Perhaps the next fifty 
years may see them generally adopted throughout the 
country. 



CHAPTER X 



Estates and Trusts 

ESTATES. â€” When a person who ov/ns property 
dies, the first question which arises is as to what 
becomes of his estate; who pays the bills, who 
takes charge of his business affairs, and what are the 
rules as to the division of his property. The first ques- 
tion a lawyer always asks is, *'Did the deceased die 
testate or intestate?" that is, did he leave a will or not. 
If he left a will, probably he has named one or more 
executors in his will to settle his estate, in which case 
such person or persons will take charge. If he has 
not appointed an executor in his will, an oversight 
which rarely occurs, the probate court will appoint 
an administrator. If, on the other hand, the man died 
intestate, it will be absolutely necessary for the court 
to appoint an administrator. The executor will settle 
up the estate according to the directions contained in 
the will, but if no will was made, the administrator 
will settle up the estate according to the rules of the 
probate court, under which he is acting, and the prop- 
erty will be divided in accordance with the statutes of 
the State or States having jurisdiction over the es- 
tate. 

CHARACTER OF PROPERTY.â€” It is very 
essential to distinguish carefully between the two 
kinds of property, real and personal, which the de- 
ceased leaves. Real property, as we have explained, 
consists of land with the buildings permanently at- 

321 



322 COMMERCIAL LAW 

tached to it, and all other property is personal prop- 
erty, although it may relate to real property. Thus, a 
mortgage on land is personal property, also the shares 
of stock in a corporation, although the corporation 
may be organized to engage exclusively in the owner- 
ship of real property, is personal property. Where a 
person dies leaving a will, his real property goes 
directly to the persons to whom he leaves it in the 
will. In the case where he dies intestate, his real prop- 
erty passes directly to his heirs at law, who are desig- 
nated by statute. In neither case is any formality 
necessary, beyond the probate of the will, to vest the 
devisee of the testator or the heirs at law of the in- 
testate with the title to the real property. The situa- 
tion in regard to personal property is quite different. 
Where the deceased died leaving a will, his executor 
immediately has title to all the personal property. If 
he dies intestate, the administrator will take title as 
soon as appointed. The personal property is used by 
the executor or administrator to pay debts, and the 
real property, whether a man dies testate or intestate, 
is never used to pay debts unless the personal prop- 
erty is insufficient. 

WILLS DEFINED.â€” The definition of Jarman 
is commonly used in defining a will : "A will is the in- 
strument by which a person makes a disposition of his 
property to take effect after his decease, and which is, 
in its own nature, ambulatory, and revocable during 
his life." This definition is open to one criticism. It 
does not include oral wills which, as we shall see, are 
sometimes legal. We shall also use other terms in 



COMMERCIAL LAW 323 

this chapter which must be defined. A testator is the 
man who makes the will, while the testatrix is a 
woman making a will. A codicil is a supplement to a 
will, made and executed with the same formality as 
the original will, and it becomes a part of the original 
will, adding to it, or altering it, as the case may be. 
A devisee is a person who takes real property under a 
will, while a legatee takes personal property under a 
will, and the real property passing under the will is 
called a devise, and the personal property a bequest. 
A legacy refers to money passing under a will. This 
is why the ordinary will uses this phrase: "I give, 
devise, and bequeath." It is not fatal, however, to 
make a mistake of having the will read, "I hereby 
devise," referring to personal property. It is more a 
mistake in the use of English, than a mistake in law to 
make a wrong choice of these terms which we have 
just defined. A holographic or olographic will is a 
will v/hich is wholly written in the testator's or testa- 
trix's own hand. The statutes of a few States recog- 
nize these wills as valid without the formal execution 
or attestation if they are wholly written, signed, and 
sealed by the testator's own hand. A nuncupative will 
is an oral will. While most wills must be in writing, 
in many jurisdictions the oral wills made by sailors 
at sea, and soldiers in actual service are recognized as 
valid without being reduced to writing and without 
any specified number of witnesses. It is perfectly ap- 
parent why these exceptions are made, because of the 
difficulty of securing the materials with which to 
make a written will by these two classes of people. 



324 COMMERCIAL LAW 

Nuncupative wills are good only to dispose of personal 
property, unless a special statute has been enacted 
which provides otherwise, but this is not commonly 
done. 

A WILL AND A GIFT CAUSA MORTIS DIS- 
TINGUISHED.â€” We have already referred to gifts 
causa mortis which are gifts of personal property 
made by the donor under apprehension of immediate 
death, coupled with the delivery of the property. The 
gift is defeated by the recovery of the donor. A gift 
causa mortis, may be made orally, while, with the ex- 
ception of nuncupative wills, all wills must be in writ- 
ing. A gift causa mortis must be made under fear of 
pending death, whereas a will is ordinarily made with 
a view of the fact of death but not of its immediate 
happening. Again, delivery is necessary to make a 
gift causa mortis, whereas under a will delivery never 
takes effect until after the person dies, and then the 
legatee's title comes through the executor or admin- 
istrator, and not directly from the testator. Real 
property is not the subject of a gift causa mortis, 
whereas a will may dispose of both real and personal 
property. 

WHO MAY MAKE A WILL.â€” As a general 
rule, any person of sound mind and of the age of 
twenty-one years may make a will. In. some States, a 
person eighteen years of age may make a will of per- 
sonal property. Formerly a married woman could not 
make a valid will excepting in a few instances, but to- 
day, by statute, this common law disability has been 
either wholly or largely removed. The statutes of the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 325 

particular State in which the married woman resides, 
or in which her property is situated should always be 
consulted. 

TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY.â€” Another 
qualification is that the testator must have sufficient 
intellectual powers to enable him to be said to have 
"a sound and disposing mind, memory, and under- 
standing." The case of Whitney v. Twombly, 136 
Mass. 145, gives us as good a general statement as 
there is concerning the nature of testamentary capac- 
ity: "A testator has a sound mind for testamentary 
purposes, only when he can understand and carry in 
mind, in a general way, the nature and situation of 
his property, and his relations to the persons around 
him, to those who naturally have some claim to his 
remembrance, and to those in whom, and the things 
in which, he has been chiefly interested. He must 
understand the act which he is doing, the disposition 
which he wishes to make of his property, and the 
relation in which he stands to the objects of his bounty 
and to those who ought to be in his mind on the oc- 
casion of making his will." The ability to make a 
will is not necessarily gone because the testator is old, 
weak or ill, even practically at the point of death. The 
physical condition is simply significant in determining 
the mental condition, but of course a very weak physi- 
cal condition does not necessarily mean a weak intel- 
lectual condition. Insane persons are not capable of 
making wills, but a person who is insane may still 
have a "lucid interval" during which time he is suffi- 
ciently restored to his normal condition to enable him 



326 COMMERCIAL LAW 

to act with such reason as to make a valid will, al- 
though he may, very soon, relapse into his former 
insane condition. Ordinarily most peculiarities and 
eccentricities on the part of the testator do not affect 
his ability to make a will ; neither do peculiar religious 
beliefs have any effect unless, in any of these cases, 
the person's mind is so completely controlled as to 
prevent the exercise of rational judgment in dispos- 
ing of his property. His eccentricities must amount 
almost, in such cases, to a form of insanity to have this 
effect. 

HOW A WILL MUST BE EXECUTED.â€” 
There are four requirements for the execution of a 
valid will: 

(1) It must be in writing. 

(2) It must be signed by the testator. 

(3) The testator's signature must be made by the 
testator or the marking acknowledged by him in the 
presence of the necessary number of witnesses. 

(4) It must be declared by the testator to be his 
last will in the presence of the necessary number of 
witnesses, who are present at the same time and who 
subscribe their names as witnesses in the presence of 
the testator. 

OTHER FORMALITIES.â€” No particular form 
of writing is necessary. Probably typing is the most 
common form in use to-day. As a precaution, lawyers 
sometimes have the testator sign at the bottom of each 
typewritten page, where the will is of several pages, 
or the document is fastened together with silk, the 
two ends of which are carried to the last page and im- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 327 

bedded in a wax seal. The testator should sign the 
wiH'himself unless he is unable to, from lack of educa- 
tion or feebleness, in which case, the statute generally 
makes provision for another form of signing. It is 
better practice for the testator to sign the will in the 
presence of his witnesses, acknowledge the signature, 
and then the testator should declare, in the presence 
of his witnesses, that this is his last will and testament. 
In many States, two witnesses are all that are neces- 
sary; a few States require three. Careful practice 
generally calls for three. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” A testator lives in New 
York. He has two witnesses to his will. His will is valid 
as far as his real property in that State is concerned, but 
should it happen that he also owns real property in a 
State where three witnesses are required, his will 
would not pass title to the real property in that State 
and, as far as that State is concerned, he would die in- 
testate, and that real property would descend to his 
heirs in accordance with the laws of that State, which 
would quite likely not be what the testator intended to 
happen. By having three witnesses, his will is just as 
good in New York, where only two are necessary and 
the presence of the third witness makes the will good, 
and passes the real property situated in the State 
where three are required. It is always best to have 
the witnesses add their addresses to their signatures. 
This is not required by statute in many States, but 
after a person's decease, it may help in locating the 
witnesses by having addresses to which to refer. It 
is, of course, wise to use some care in the selection of 



328 COMMERCIAL LAW 

witnesses, although almost any person is competent. 
Adults, of course, are preferable as witnesses, but an 
infant is a perfectly good witness, but he should pos- 
sess sufficient intelligence to be able to appreciate the 
importance of the act he is witnessing. In view of the 
formalities to be observed in the execution of a will, 
and the technical niceties in the use of the proper word 
or phrase, often required to insure the expression of 
the testator's exact intention, the drafting of a will 
should never be left to a layman, but should always be 
entrusted to a lawyer. 

THE FORM OF A WILL.â€” -In our discussion 
it is well to keep in mind the form of a will. A simple 
will reads as follows : 

IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN: 

I, John Jones, of the Borough of Manhattan, City 
and State of New York, being of sound and disposing 
mind and understanding, do make, publish, and de- 
clare this my last will and testament, as follows: 

First. I direct that all of my just debts and my 
funeral expenses be paid as soon after my death as 
conveniently may be. 

Second. I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, 
residue and remainder of my estate, whether real, 
personal, or mixed, of whatsoever kind, character or 
description, and wheresoever situated, unto my wife, 
Emma Jones, for and during the period of her natural 
life. 

Third. Upon the death of my said wife Emma, I 
give, devise and bequeath the said residue and re- 
mainder of my estate to my childen, Alice Jones, 



COMMERCIAL LAW 329 

Sarah Jones, and George Jones, to them, their heirs, 
executors, administrators and assigns forever, share 
and share alike, per stirpes and not per capita. 

Fourth. This will shall remain in full force and 
effect notwithstanding children may hereafter be bom 
to me. 

Fifth. I nominate, constitute, and appoint my 
said wife Emma, and the Institute Trust Company, 
executors of this my last will, giving to them full 
power and authority to sell and convey any and all 
real estate, whereof I may die seized, at such times and 
for such prices as they may consider for the best inter- 
ests of my estate. 

Sixth. I hereby revoke any and all wills at any 
time by me heretofore made. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set 
my hand and seal this first day of July, 1921. 

(Signed) JOHN JONES (L. S.). 

Signed, sealed, published and declared by John 
Jones, the above-named testator, as and for his Last 
Will and Testament, in the presence of us, and each 
of us, and at the same time declared by him to us, and 
each of us, to be his Last Will and Testament, and 
thereupon we, at his request, and in his presence and 
in the presence of each other, have hereunto sub- 
scribed our names as witnesses, this first day of July, 
1921.

S30 COMMERCIAL LAW 

REVOCATION.-â€” A will may be revoked at any 
time at the pleasure of the testator. The ordinary 
ways of accomplishing a revocation of a will are: 
(1) The testator executes a later will, and in express 
terms says, **I hereby revoke all former wills by me 
made." Even if such an expression is not put in the 
second will, if its terms are wholly inconsistent with 
the former will, this in itself, will act as a revocation. 
Again, a will may be revoked by mutilation, as by be- 
ing burned, torn, or otherwise mutilated by the testa- 
tor himself, or in his presence and by his direction. 
The mutilation of the will, however, if not accom- 
panied by an intent thereby to revoke it, is of no effect. 
I think I am tearing up an old insurance policy, but 
because of poor eye-sight, discover later that I have 
torn my will. This would not amount to a revoca- 
tion of the will. As has been said by a writer on the 
subject of wills, "No amount of cancellation or de- 
struction without the intent to revoke, and no amount 
of intent without the actual destruction, will suffice 
to revoke a will. Both the intent and the actual de- 
struction or cancellation must coexist." 

Sometimes changes in the circumstances and con- 
ditions of the testator's life will work a revocation. 
For example, at common law, the marriage of a 
woman worked an absolute revocation of her will. 
This has now been changed in most States by statute. 
In a great many States, however, today, if a testator, 
having no children, should make his will, and after 
the execution of the will, a child is born, the will is 
revoked in toto, when no provision for such child is 



COMMERCIAL LAW 331 

made in the will. However, as above stated, this rule 
is not uniform in all States, and local statutes should 
therefore be consulted on this point. Where a testa- 
tor already has children, the birth of additional chil- 
dren will not affect his will except, that such after- 
born children will inherit the same as though he had 
left no will. These rules in regard to after-born 
children apply only where the will does not make any 
mention of possible issue, and for this reason it is well 
to insert the clause, in many jurisdictions, providing 
that the will shall remain in full force and effect not- 
withstanding the fact that children may thereafter be 
born to the testator. 

PROBATE OF WILLS.â€” Every State has a 
probate court for the settlement of decedents' estates. 
Such a court is variously named as the probate court, 
the surrogate's court, and the like, according to the 
nomenclature adopted in a particular State. Before 
an executor named in a will has any authority to act, 
he must produce the will, and after the proper pro- 
ceeding has been had, the will is admitted to probate, 
and he may then qualify under it by giving the neces- 
sary bond. If the deceased died intestate, the proper 
person will apply to the probate court for the ap- 
pointment of an administrator, and after a hearing, 
the court will appoint the person entitled to receive 
letters of administration. The administrator will 
then qualify, give the necessary bond, and then pro- 
ceed with the settling of the estate. 

A testator may name anyone in his will as an exec- 
utor. In the large cities, in recent years, it is be- 



332 COMMERCIAL LAW 

coming quite common to name a trust company as 
executor, because its facilities for handling estates 
render it more efficient than the average individual. 
If, on the other hand, the testator is unwilling to 
place the sole care of his estate in the hands of a 
trust company, he may name two executors, a trust 
company and his wife, if he is a married man, or a 
very close friend in whose judgment he has great con- 
fidence, and, together, the two act as executors. The 
fees which the executors receive are generally fixed 
by statute. If the deceased dies intestate, the letters 
of administration are granted by the court in accord- 
ance with a definite statute. While the law in the vari- 
ous States is not uniform, generally, the priority of 
the right to administration is arranged by statute 
something like this : 

(1) On the estate of a husband: 

(a) To the widow, if there is any. 

(b) If there is no widow, or if the widow re- 
nounces, then to the children. 

(c) If there are no children, then to the is- 
sue of deceased children. 

(d) If no issue of deceased children, then to 
the nearest of kin. 

(2) On the estate of a wife: 

(a) To the husband, who has an absolute 
right. If the husband for any reason does not 
desire to act as such administrator, he may 
select any fit person to administer the estate. 

(b) If there is no husband, then to the chil- 
dren. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 333 

(c) If no children, then to the issue of 
deceased children. 

(d) If no issue of deceased children, then to 
the nearest of kin. 

(3) On the estate of an unmarried child: 

(a) To the father, who has an absolute 
right. If for any reason the father does not 
wish to act, the court may select any fit person 
to administer the estate. 

(b) If there is no father, then to the mother 
and brothers and sisters, whether of whole or 
half blood. 

(c) If no mother or brothers or sisters, then 
to the nearest of kin in equal degree. 

PER STIRPES AND PER CAPITA.â€” Where 
the subject of a testamentary disposition is directed 
to be "equally divided" or to be divided "share and 
share alike," or where similar words are used which 
indicate an equal division among a class of persons, the 
persons among whom the division is to be made take 
per capita, unless a contrary intention is discoverable 
from the will. Where the individuals of a class are 
specifically named, or are designated by their rela- 
tion to some ancestor living at the date of the will, 
whether the testator or another, they take per capita, 
unless the context of the will shows an intention that 
they should take per stirpes. But where the gift is 
to an individual, or several named individuals, and to 
others as a class, the latter take per stirpes ; unless the 
testator uses language indicating an intention that 
the members of the class shall share equally with the 



334 COMMERCIAL LAW 

named individuals. A gift to a class of persons or on 
their death to their heirs or children will be distributed 
among such heirs or children per stirpes; but a gift to 
one person and the children of other deceased persons 
will be divided per capita, unless it appears from the 
context or circumstances shown by extraneous evi- 
dence that the testator intended a distribution per 
stirpes. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” A gift to children of testa- 
tor, A. B. and C, or on their death to their heirs or 
children will be distributed, in the event of the death 
of C. before the testator, among heirs or children 
of C. per stirpes. (In other words, they will divide 
the share of their father between them.) But a gift 
to A. and to X. Y. and Z., the children of B. deceased, 
will be divided per capita. 

THE CONSTRUCTION OF WILLS.â€” It 
sometimes happens that wills are not carefully drawn, 
and even if they are, their meaning is not always per- 
fectly clear. Ordinarily, and person who is interest- 
ed in the meaning of a clause of a will may bring a 
suit in the proper court asking for a construction of 
the will. Of course, each case is governed more or 
less, by its own facts, but there are certain general 
rules which the courts follow in trying to arrive at 
the testator's intent. For example, a will is ordi- 
narily presumed to speak as of the time of the testa- 
tor's death. Thus, reference in a will, to the arrival 
of the testator's youngest child at the age of twenty- 
five years, will apply to the youngest child at the time 
of the testator's death, although such child is born 



COMMERCIAL LAW 335 

after the execution of the will. Ordinarily, a testa- 
tor is presumed to have intended to dispose of all of 
his property, and if a will can be so construed, this 
will be done, rather than to adopt a construction 
which will make him testate as to part of his property 
and intestate as to another part. If there are two 
irreconcilable parts, the latter part is the one which 
prevails. Words are to be understood in their ordi- 
nary meaning, unless there is something to clearly 
show contrary intent. If, between two possible con- 
structions, one of which would disclose a legal pur- 
pose, and the other an illegal purpose, the court will 
adopt the former. 

DOWER. â€” Under the rules of the common law, 
a wife was entitled, on the death of her husband, to an 
estate for life in one-third of the lands of which her 
husband was seized of an estate of inheritance at any 
time during the marriage. This dower right still 
exists in most States, although it may differ in some 
particulars. For example, in Connecticut, a dower 
right exists only in the real property which the hus- 
band owns at the time of his death, and not, as at 
common law, in all the real property of which he was 
seized during the whole marriage. Therefore, 
reference to the statutes must be made in each State, 
to know the exact rule in a particular jurisdiction. 
Where the State adheres closely to the common law, 
this right, on the part of the wife, is a right of which 
her husband cannot deprive her; if the husband dis- 
poses of all his real property in his will to his friend, 
John Jones, such disposition is not valid and the wife 



336 COMMERCIAL LAW 

would still be allowed her dower right by the probate 
court. It must also be borne in mind that dower 
refers only to real property. Generally, a husband 
may dispose of his personal property without any 
reference to his wife. Ordinarily, two things are 
necessary to establish the right of dower: (1) A 
legal marriage, and (2) seizin by the husband of an 
estate of inheritance in lands, or, in a layman's terms, 
the absolute ownership of a piece of real estate. 

CURTESY.â€” Curtesy is the common law right 
which a husband has in the real property of his wife, 
and by it he is entitled to an estate for his life in all 
lands of which his wife was seized during marriage. 
Needless to say, women did not take part in law mak- 
ing when this law arose. To establish this right, 
three things are necessary: The two already men- 
tioned in dower, and third, the birth alive of issue of 
the marriage. The right of curtesy does not exist 
in this common law form in as many States as does 
the right of dower. Where these two rights do exist, 
in their more or less modified form, you have the ex- 
planation of the fact that when a married man sells 
real property, his wife joins in the deed, or when a 
married woman sells real property, her husband joins 
in the deed. The act of either in joining, releases the 
dower or curtesy right and allows the purchaser to 
get a clear title. 

CONFLICT OF LAWS.â€” We have already re- 
ferred to this topic. It frequently happens that a 
person dies owning real property located in a number 
of States. It is almost certain that the laws covering 



COMMERCIAL LAW 337 

real property will vary in these different States. If 
he was a resident of Philadelphia, his will will prob- 
ably have been executed in accordance with the laws 
of Pennsylvania. The question arises whether such 
a will is valid to convey real property which he owns 
in New York, California, and Massachusetts. Inso- 
far as the will affects real property, the mode of exe- 
cution and its validity will be controlled by the law 
of the jurisdiction in which the real property is 
situated. If, then, the will had two witnesses only, as 
required by the Pennsylvania law, but three witnesses 
are required in one of the other States named, he 
would die intestate as far as the real property in the 
other State is concerned. Difficult questions some- 
times arise in regard to gifts to charities. Some 
States limit the amount which a charitable corpora- 
tion may receive as a gift under a will, and other 
States require that the gifts must be executed within 
a certain time before the decedent's death. Where 
there is a question of this character involved only a 
careful examination of the decisions and statutes in 
the States concerned can furnish the basis for any 
satisfactory answer. If there is personal property, 
the requisites of validity and construction of a will 
are controlled by the law of the testator's domicile. 
The question as to his domicile is sometimes quite 
difficult to determine and may require a court action. 
We have had a number of illustrations of that in con- 
nection with the inheritance tax laws, where the of- 
ficers of one State have sought to establish the domi- 
cile of a particularly wealthy person, who has just 



338 COMMERCIAL LAW 

died, within that State in order that they may secure 
the inheritance tax for the State, which would of 
course, be much larger if the person were adjudged 
a resident of that State than it would be if he were 
held to be a non-resident. 

CONTRACTS TO MAKE A WILL.â€” It some- 
times happens that one person may make a contract 
whereby he agrees to make a will in favor of another 
person. A, 75 years old, and of the proper mental 
capacity to make a will, makes a contract with Mary 
Jones, that, if she will live in his house and act as 
housekeeper as long as he lives, he will make a will 
and in it give her his house and $5000. He fails to 
make his will and dies suddenly at the end of the year 
after the making of this contract. It is generally 
recognized that contracts of this nature are valid. 
The general rules applicable to contracts apply here. 
There must be consideration, the contract must be 
certain in its terms, and as such contracts are not 
favored by the courts, because they are open to many 
forms of fraud, they must be proved by clear and con- 
vincing evidence, and the contract would have to be 
in writing under the provisions of the Statute of 
Frauds. In the illustration suggested, the further 
question arises, what is the remedy on the part of the 
housekeeper for a breach of contract. Ordinarily 
there are two proceedings open in such a case. The 
personal representative of the deceased might be sued 
at law to recover damages for a breach of contract, or 
one might proceed in equity to compel the parties 
who take the legal title to the house, in consequence 



COMMERCIAL LAW 339 

of the failure of the decedent to make his will as he 
contracted to do, to convey the property which would 
have been conveyed by the will, had the will been 
made in compliance with the contract. 

TRUSTS DEFINED.â€” In Bouvier's Law Dic- 
tionary, trusts are defined as obligations imposed, 
either expressly or by implication of law, whereby 
the obligor is bound to deal with property, over which 
he has control, for the benefit of certain persons of 
whom he may himself be one, and any one of whom 
may enforce the obligation. A trust arises when prop- 
erty has been conveyed to one person and accepted 
by him for the benefit of another. The person who 
holds the property and the legal title is called the 
trustee, and the person for whom it is held is termed 
the beneficiary or "cestui que trust." Trusts are 
created for a great variety of purposes. It is very 
common to create them by a will, the testator ap- 
pointing a trustee to manage a trust fund which he 
sets aside for the maintenance and support of a cer- 
tain person or a certain institution. A new device for 
creating a trust for the carrying on of a business, seems 
to be growing in popularity. The practice apparently 
began in Massachusetts with the creation of a trust 
for the operation of an office building and similar 
undertakings. Under this arrangement, a trust 
estate may have transferable shares, exemption of 
shareholder's liability, and frequently enjoys peculiar 
advantages in taxation matters. These organiza- 
tions are sometimes spoken of as common law cor- 
porations. They are so comparatively new that the 



340 COMMERCIAL LAW 

closest care should be exercised in operating a busi- 
ness under this form of organization. We shall now 
consider the powers and duties of trustees and include 
with them executors and administrators. 

TRUSTEES, EXECUTORS, AND ADMINIS- 
TRATORS. â€” Trustees, executors and administra- 
tors may be classed together because they are alike 
in that they hold legal title to property which is held 
by them for the benefit of other persons. They hold 
the legal title. A trustee is the owner of the prop- 
erty, and any one who seeks a transfer of the legal 
title of the property must get it from the trustee. 
Executors have exactly the same powers as admin- 
istrators, aside from powers that may be expressly 
given in the will. The difference in name is simply 
because an executor is appointed by the will of the 
testator, whereas an administrator is appointed by 
the court to take charge of an estate for which no 
executor has been named in a testator's will, or where 
the executor may have died or refused to act, or, the 
most frequent case, where the deceased died intestate. 

THEIR APPOINTMENT.â€” Were it not for 
statutes, a trustee or an executor would become such 
simply because somebody had made him a trustee or 
an executor without any appointment or assistance 
from the court. But in the appointment of executors 
or trustees, under wills, the court is by statute 
generally required to make an appointment to give 
validity to a nomination or appointment in the testa- 
tor's will. Administrators, of course, from their 
very nature, have to be appointed by the court. A 



COMMERCIAL LAW 341 

trust, however, may be created between living per- 
sons without any appointment by the court, and 
frequently is. A real estate trust may be created by 
simply conveying property to trustees on the trust 
that they manage it and pay the income to the bene- 
ficiaries, and a great variety of trusts are constantly 
created without an appointment from the court. 
Wherever any question on a trust arises, or wher- 
ever the appointment of a new trustee is necessary, 
however, the court has jurisdiction, and any person 
interested in the trust can bring the matter before 
the court. When a testator dies the person named 
as executor in the will petitions for appointment, 
and unless there is some reason why he should not 
be appointed he doubtless will be appointed. If 
there is no executor, then the persons, or benefi- 
ciaries, interested in the estate, usually agree on some 
one to administer the estate, and a petition is filed for 
his appointment. The person who is next of kin, and 
competent to act, is generally appointed in the ab- 
sence of agreement. These officers remain in office 
and retain their powers until their work is completed, 
unless they are sooner removed, which they may be 
at any time for cause. 

THEIR POWERS.â€” What powers do these 
persons have? Do they have power to sell? We 
must first always look at the terms of the trust. If 
we are dealing with a trustee under a will we look 
at the will to see what powers the testator gave him. 
If we are looking at a question of a trust under a deed, 
we look at the deed, and the right of an executor to 



342 COMMERCIAL LAW 

sell real estate similarly depends on whether any 
such power has been given him in the will. Aside 
from express power given in the instrument, a trus- 
tee has no power to sell either real or personal prop- 
erty unless the power is expressly given or unless the 
nature of the trust is such as necessarily implies the 
power, and courts are very slow in construing the 
existence of such power by implication. An exe- 
cutor, on the other hand, since his duty is to reduce 
the personal property of an estate to cash, and dis- 
tribute it, has, in most States, implied power to sell 
personal property. He has, however, no power to 
sell real estate unless the will expressly gives such 
power. The court may authorize him to sell real 
estate, and will authorize him, if it is necessary to 
pay debts or legacies, but only in such cases unless 
a power is expressly given. Trustees, executors and 
administrators have no power to pledge property un- 
less expressly given in the instrument under which 
they act. They have power to make such contracts 
as are necessary to carry out their trust, but only 
these, and even when they make such contracts they 
are personally liable upon them, having, however, a 
right of reimbursement from the estate which they 
represent. If they entered into an unauthorized 
contract they would be liable upon it personally and 
have no right of reimbursement. 

THEIR DUTIES.â€” Their first duty is the care 
and custody of the property in their charge. A 
trustee, whose duty is to hold property, is bound to 
keep it invested so as to bring in an income, whereas 



COMMERCIAL LAW 343 

an executor has no right to invest funds of the estate, 
except under the direction of the court; if he does 
so he will take the chance of loss, and the beneficiary 
can not only hold him liable for loss but can also take 
the profit should the investment prove profitable. 
The executor's duty is to reduce the property to cash 
and distribute it to the proper parties. All these offi- 
cers owe the same duty of fidelity to their beneficiary 
that an agent owes to his principal. There is the 
same duty to execute the trust personally and not 
delegate authority, except in regard to ministerial or 
mechanical acts. There is the same duty to account, 
and furthermore, the accounts of these officers, if 
they are appointed by the court, must be filed in court. 
The trustee to carry out his trust will ordinarily dis- 
tribute the income to the persons entitled, but, of 
course, trusts are of great variety, and not infre- 
quently the object of a trust is to accumulate the 
income. Whatever the terms of the trust are they 
must be carried out. The duties of the executor and 
administrator are to distribute the estate by paying 
creditors first and the surplus to legatees or the next 
of kin legally entitled. They are allowed a fixed 
period, in many States two years, to settle an estate. 
One of the most essential duties of any fiduciary 
is to keep the property he holds as a fiduciary sep- 
arate and distinct from his own. This means that a 
trustee or executor receiving current income must 
keep a separate bank account as trustee or executor, 
and of course he should not draw checks on that fund 
for personal debts. 



CHAPTER XI 



Carriers and Warehousemen 

CARRIERS WHO ARE PUBLIC SERVICE 
COMPANIES.â€” Common Carriersâ€”that is, 
railroads, express companies, and other per- 
sons or corporations who carry goods for hire and 
hold themselves out to the public as engaged in the 
business of carrying goods for anybody for hire â€” are 
engaged in a public service. A man who owns a tramp 
steamer and gets cargoes as he can, is not engaged in a 
public service â€” he is not a common carrier or public 
carrier; but a person who has a line of steamers, or 
even one steamer, regularly engaged in plying be- 
tween different places and taking goods as offered for 
hire, is engaged in public service. 

DUTIES OF ONE ENGAGED IN PUBLIC 
SERVICE. â€” Now, being engaged in public service 
subjects a person or corporation who is so engaged to 
some special duties. Such a person cannot make any 
bargain he pleases with anybody he pleases, and re- 
fuse to make bargains with others, as an ordinary 
person can. It is the duty of any one engaged in a 
public service to give reasonable service to all who 
apply, without discrimination, and for reasonable 
compensation. Of course, carriers are not the only 
public-service corporations; electric light companies 
or gas companies or water companies are other illus- 
trations; but common carriers, and especially railroads, 
are the most prominent public-service corporations. 

344 



COMMERCIAL LAW 345 

RAILROAD COMMISSIONS.â€” Not only is 
there this common-law duty to serve all without dis- 
crimination and at reasonable prices, but both the 
States and the United States have established commis- 
sions to look after railroads and other carriers to see 
that they properly perform their duties. The Rail- 
road or Public Service Commission in most States 
has a great variety of powers for compelling railroads 
to give proper service. The chief function of the 
Federal Interstate Commerce Commission originally, 
was in regard to rates, but its powers have since been 
enlarged by legislation. The Interstate Commerce 
Commission has the power concerning interstate com- 
merce to say whether rates and practices are rea- 
sonable. A carrier is obliged to file with the In- 
terstate Commerce Commission a schedule of its 
rates, and regulations concerning rates, and is also 
required to post these rates publicly in its stations. 
If anybody objects to the rates they must make com- 
plaint before the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
That is the only form of redress, and sometimes not 
an easy one for a person who is merely interested in 
a single shipment, because the expense and delay of 
proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Com- 
mission are such as to be prohibitive, unless the com- 
plainant's financial interest in the matter is consider- 
able. It is common, therefore, for shippers' associa- 
tions to take that sort of question up rather than to 
leave it for individual shippers. Any contract made 
by a carrier for either more or less than the scheduled 
rate is illegal and void. 



346 COMMERCIAL LAW 

CARRIER'S COMMON-LAW LIABILITY 
FOR GOODS. â€” A carrier, at common law, when he 
receives goods for transportation, is subject to a de- 
gree of liability beyond that imposed on any other 
person. An ordinary person who receives goods â€” a 
bailee, as he is called in law â€” is merely liable for the 
consequences of his negligence. A carrier, however, 
while goods are in course of transportation is liable, 
at common law, as an insurer against all kinds of ac- 
cidents except those caused by act of God or public 
enemies. For instance, if goods were struck by 
lightning in transit that would be an act of God, and 
the carrier would not be liable; but if goods caught 
fire from any other cause, as from neglect of an out- 
sider or the act of an incendiary, the carrier would be 
liable. Carriers, of course, dislike that and try to 
contract away their liability. They are allowed by 
law to do so, except that they are not allowed to 
contract for exemption from the consequences of 
their own negligence. It is largely this desire of car- 
riers to free themselves from the extreme liability 
which the common law imposes on them, that in- 
duces them to give bills of lading. Bills of lading are 
often required by law, but carriers are pleased to 
issue them, as they can in that way contract to ex- 
empt themselves from this extreme liability, which 
lasts while the goods are in transit and until the con- 
signee has had a reasonable time to remove them 
from the carrier's possession. If the consignee fails 
to remove them with reasonable promptness the car- 
rier then becomes liable, merely as a warehouseman 



COMMERCIAL LAW 347 

may, for its own neglect. The extreme liability of 
the carrier does not extend to damage caused by de- 
lay. The carrier is liable for delays in so far as they 
are caused by its own neglect, but otherwise is not 
liable. A carrier need not deliver the goods unless 
freight is paid, as it has a lien for freight charges. 

THREEFOLD NATURE OF BILL OF LAD- 
ING. â€” A bill of lading issued by a carrier for goods 
has a threefold character. In the first place it is a 
receipt. The importance of a receipt is as evidence 
of just what was shipped. It is important to the 
shipper as proof that the carrier received goods, of 
such a quantity and of such a description, in good 
order. It is important to the carrier as proof of the 
same thing, to prevent the shipper from claiming that 
he has shipped different kinds or quantities of goods 
from those described in the bill of lading. The sec- 
ond aspect of a bill of lading is as a contract. It is 
not only a receipt but a contract between the parties, 
the shipper and the carrier. It is as a contract that 
the stipulations it contains for limitation, of liability 
are important. Third, it is an order, when properly 
indorsed and surrendered, for the delivery of the 
goods. 

CARRIERS CAN DELIVER GOODS ONLY 
TO HOLDERS OF ORDER BILLS OF LADING. 
â€” The thing that makes a bill of lading valuable, to 
buy or lend money on, is the fact that the carrier will 
hold the goods behind the bill of lading until the bill 
is itself presented and surrendered. If the carrier 
were to deliver the goods upon demand to anybody, 



348 COMMERCIAL LAW 

other than the holder of the bill of lading, it is obvi- 
ous that there would not be much use in holding the 
bill of lading. The carriers have made a great con- 
test on this question in the past. They have con- 
tended that they fulfill their duty if they deliver the 
goods to the consignee originally named in the bill 
of lading, whether that consignee continues to hold 
the documents or not. But that has been decided 
against them so far as order bills are concerned (that 
is, bills, which state that the goods are deliverable 
not simply to a consignee but to the order of a con- 
signee) and these order bills have printed on them 
the provision that the bill itself must be surrendered 
before the goods will be delivered. 

CARRIERS MAY DELIVER TO CON- 
SIGNEE OF STRAIGHT BILLS OF LADING.â€” 
In a straight or flat bill, however (that is, one with- 
out the word "order") the carrier's contention has been 
upheld and the carrier is allowed to deliver the goods 
to the consignee, even though the consignee does not 
present the bill of lading and for all the carrier knows 
is not the owner of the bill of lading or of the goods. 

BILLS OF LADING USED TO ENABLE 
SELLER TO RETAIN HOLD ON GOODS.â€” The 
ways in which bills of lading may be used, and are 
used, in the mercantile world, must be understood 
before the legal questions which arise, concerning 
them, can be grasped. The primary and original pur- 
pose of using bills of lading as symbols of the goods, 
was doubtless to secure the seller in his hold on the 
goods until he received the price, and that is still a 



COMMERCIAL LAW 349 

vital purpose in the use of bills of lading. We have 
learned, in the case of the sale of goods, that unless 
credit is given, the delivery of the goods and the 
payment of the price are concurrent conditions. 
Now, when the parties reside at a distance there is 
difficulty in working out these concurrent conditions. 
If the seller ships the goods directly to the buyer, he 
loses his hold on the goods, and if the buyer does 
not keep his agreement to pay promptly, the seller 
will be unable to do anything about it. On the other 
hand, of course, the buyer does not want to pay in 
advance. Now, by means of bills of lading, the seller 
is enabled to keep his hold on the goods until he re- 
ceives the price, and the buyer is enabled to secure 
possession of the goods as soon as he pays the price. 

STRAIGHT BILLS TO BUYER GIVE THE 
SELLER NO HOLD ON GOODS.â€” The bill of lad- 
ing may be used in various ways. Suppose, first, the 
seller when he ships the goods takes a straight bill 
to the buyer. That will not give the seller any hold, 
for the carrier will be discharged if without demand- 
ing the surrender of the bill of lading, he delivers to 
the consignee named. So we may cross off that as a 
possible means of protecting the seller. 

STRAIGHT BILLS TO THE SELLER.â€” The 
second possibility is for the seller to take a straight 
bill, naming himself as consignee as well as consigner. 
If that is done the buyer cannot get the goods at once. 
Suppose the bill of lading was sent forward, even that 
would not of itself enable the buyer to get the goods, 
if the carrier wished to be technical, since in a straight 



350 COMMERCIAL LAW 

bill the goods are deliverable not to the holder of the 
bill, but to the consignee named therein. There would 
have to be attached to the bill of lading an order from 
the seller, who is named as consignee in the bill, direct- 
ing the railroad to deliver the goods to the buyer in- 
stead of to himself, the consignee named in the bill. 
That would be a perfectly feasible matter, but this 
method is not much used, and one reason why it is 
not much used is because the seller frequently wants 
to do something else besides keep control of the goods 
until the buyer pays for them. He oftentimes wants 
to get money from a bank in the meantime. 

USE OF BILLS OF LADING BY SELLER 
TO OBTAIN LOANS.â€” When the seller is desirous 
of borrowing money from a bank, he takes the bill of 
lading to the bank with a bill of exchange drawn on 
the buyer, and he asks the bank at his home town to 
discount the bill of exchange, taking as security the 
bill of lading. If his home bank does this, it then sends 
the draft, with bill of lading attached, to its corre- 
spondent bank in the buyer's city, where the draft is 
presented to the drawee, who is the buyer, and if the 
buyer honors the draft then he is given the bill of 
lading. Now, banks would not do this, ought not to do 
it (occasionally they have), with a straight bill, even 
if the bill is drawn naming the seller as consignee, 
for the bank when it discounts the bill of exchange 
and gets the bill of lading as security gets no real 
hold on the goods. The railroad may deliver the 
goods to the consignee â€” the seller â€” without ever see- 
ing the bill of lading, and without the bank, which 



COMMERCIAL LAW 351 

holds the bill of lading, ever knowing anything about 
it; or the railroad may deliver to the buyer or some 
third person on a written order signed by the con- 
signee. In other words, the railroad does not have to 
hold the goods until the bill of lading, properly in- 
dorsed, is presented to it. 

STRAIGHT BILLS OF LADING GIVE NO 
SECURITY TO BANK.â€” The first and fundamental 
requirement, then, for any bank which may deal with 
bills of lading is never to have anything to do with 
straight bills. They give no security. A straight bill 
is readily distinguishable from an order bill on rail- 
roads in most parts of the country, at least, because 
uniform bills of lading are now in use, and the straight 
bill is always white and the order bill is always yel- 
low. In foreign bills a greater variety of forms are 
used, and you may have to examine the terms of the 
bill before you can feel satisfied that it is of a sort 
that will give security. The vital words in bills of 
lading, as in negotiable paper, are the words, "order 
of" or "or order." If those are in a bill of lading it 
is all right as far as this matter is concerned. There- 
fore the third and fourth possible ways in which the 
seller may take the bill of lading to secure himself 
are the only ones which will enable him to finance the 
shipment at once. 

BILLS OF LADING TO BUYER'S ORDER.â€” 
The third way which the seller may act in order to 
fulfill his purpose is to take an order bill of lading 
to the buyer's order. Although the bill of lading runs 
to the buyer's order, and although, therefore, title to 



352 COMMERCIAL LAW 

the goods will pass to the buyer on shipment, the 
buyer cannot get the goods without that bill of lading. 
Therefore, so long as the seller retains the bill of lad- 
ing nobody can get the goods from the carrier; and 
though the seller has parted with title to the goods, 
since he made the bill of lading run to the buyer's 
order, still he has retained control of them. Though 
it gives a security to the seller, and would give 
security to the bank, if the bank discounted a bill 
of exchange drawn on the buyer and took this 
bill of lading as security, it is not a desirable method 
for this reason : though the buyer cannot get the goods 
without the bill of lading, nobody else can get the 
goods without a lot of trouble, unless he has not only 
the bill of lading but the buyer's indorsement upon it. 
The bill of lading is drawn to the buyer's order, and 
if the buyer fails to pay and repudiates his contract, 
the bank or the seller will have trouble in getting back 
the goods. They will have to prove to the railroad 
that the buyer really has made default and that he no 
longer has any real interest in the goods. 

BILLS OF LADING TO THE SELLER'S OR- 
DER. â€” Accordingly, it is the fourth method which is 
in general use and which should be exclusively used. 
The seller takes the bill of lading to his own order and 
indorses it in blank; then he delivers it to his 
bank as security for a bill of exchange. If the bill of 
exchange is paid by the drawee on presentment at 
his city, he is given the bill of lading at once and he 
gets what he wants. On the other hand, if the buyer 
does not pay the draft on presentment, then the bank 



COMMERCIAL LAW 353 

can realize on the security at once, if it wants to, 
because it has a bill of lading in its hands indorsed by 
the consignee to whose order it was drawn. If the 
bank proceeds against the seller as the drawer of the 
draft, when the latter pays and takes up the bill of 
lading he can similarly realize on the security, or get 
the goods back, because he will have a bill of lading 
in his possession which runs to his own order. 

BILLS OF LADING TO "ORDER NOTIFY." 
â€” A slight modification of this form of bill of lading is 
made in order to let the buyer know when the goods 
arrive. When goods arrive at their destination it is 
a customary courtesy of railroads to notify the con- 
signee; but if goods are consigned to the seller's order, 
the man who is really trying to buy the goods gets no 
notice, as his name does not appear on the bill of lad- 
ing. To avoid that difficulty there is generally put 
on bills of lading, taken out to the seller's order when 
the goods are shipped in fulfillment of some contract 
or order, the words, "Notify X Y," X Y being the 
prospective buyer of the goods. Then when the goods 
arrive the railroad notifies X Y ; he learns the goods 
are there and makes his plans accordingly. These 
bills of lading are often called "bills to order notify." 
The person who is to be notified is sometimes incor- 
rectly called the consignee of the bill. The consignee 
is the person to whom the goods are deliverable, not 
the person who is to be notified necessarily ; and where 
a bill is to the seller's order the goods are, by the 
terms of the bill of lading, deliverable to the seller and 
he is the consignee. 



354 COMMERCIAL LAW 

CROPS ARE MOVED BY USE OF BILLS OF 
LADING. â€” The various uses of bills of lading by sell- 
ers in order to insure concurrent payment by the 
buyer, and in order, with the aid of banks, to put them- 
selves in funds while the goods are in transit, is a very 
important function of bills of lading. It is by such 
means the great crops of the country are moved, es- 
pecially the cotton crop, which is moved almost 
wholly in this manner. The southern banks discount 
bills of exchange, which are customarily secured by 
bills of lading. The New York banks rediscount these 
bills of exchange and draw for a great part of the 
price of the cotton on English bankers. This use by 
sellers of bills of lading, however, is not the only mer- 
cantile use of bills of lading. 

BILLS OF LADING TO BANKER'S ORDER. 
â€” Here is another method used, especially common in 
foreign commerce. A merchant in Boston wants to 
buy a cargo of goods from Europe, but he has not the 
money to do it. The seller in Europe does not know 
him and will not give him credit, so the merchant goes 
to bankers who have available foreign correspondents 
and states his case, and if he is in good credit with the 
bankers they say, "Order the goods from the man in 
Germany of whom you were planning to order them, 
and tell him to make the bill of lading out to us, and 
draw on us or on our correspondents in Berlin or 
London or Paris. On receipt of those bills of lading 
naming us as consignee we will pay, or cause to be 
paid, the bills of exchange attached thereto for the 
price." In this way the goods are shipped directly to 



COMMERCIAL LAW 355 

the banker. In the cases mentioned before, the banker 
took an indorsed bill of lading, but in this mode of 
dealing the banker is himself the consignee, and on the 
faith of the consignment he pays the price of the 
goods. Then he delivers the bill of lading, indorsed, 
to the buyer, his customer, on the buyer's making a 
settlement or giving him security. 

SURRENDER OF BILLS OF LADING FOR 
TRUST RECEIPTS.â€” There is one method of doing 
business in this connection which causes some risk to 
the bankers who engage in it. They frequently allow 
their customer, the buyer, to take the bill of lading, 
indorsed, for the purpose of entering the goods at the 
Custom House, or warehousing them, or even for the 
purpose of selling the goods, so that the buyer will 
be in funds to enable him to discharge his debt to the 
banker. The banker takes, when he does this, from 
the buyer to whom he delivers the indorsed bill of 
lading, what are called "trust receipts." These re- 
ceipts state that the buyer has taken these bills of lad- 
ing, that he holds them as a trustee, that they really 
belong to the banker, and that the buyer holds them 
simply for a special purpose, such as to enter them 
at the Custom House or to resell them and turn the 
proceeds over to the banker. If the buyer is honest, 
well and good ; but if he should be financially pressed 
and dispose of that bill of lading, many courts, at 
least, would not protect the banker, but would pro- 
tect the bona fide purchaser. What the banker ought 
to do is to stamp upon the bill of lading, if he delivers 
it to the buyer, that a trust receipt has been issued 



356 COMMERCIAL LAW 

for certain specified purposes. In that case any pur- 
chaser of the bill of lading would have notice of the 
terms of the trust. 

CHANGE OF ROUTING.â€” An analogous prob- 
lem also may be supposed. A bank holds a draft for 
collection with bill of lading attached. It sometimes 
allows the drawee to take possession of the bill of 
lading and change the routing of the car. That is 
done because the buyer sometimes sells the goods be- 
fore he receives them, and to save additional freight 
bills, he changes the routing on the original bills of 
lading. What risk does the bank run if it allows him 
to have possession of the bill of lading indorsed in 
blank? It runs the same risk as in case of trust re- 
ceipts. The fact that the purpose was to change the 
routing of the goods is apparently immaterial. The 
change of destination does not do the bank any ac- 
tual harm, except that the goods will be sent else- 
where, and perhaps to a point some distance from 
their original destination. The great risk involved is 
in allowing a man to have possession of a document 
which in effect is negotiable. If the bank does not 
get back its bill of lading it is in a bad position. If it 
did get back its bill of lading it would still have its 
security, only it would be subject to this difficulty, 
that the goods instead of coming to a place where the 
bank could conveniently get at them, have perhaps 
gone to a distant city, where it would be more trouble. 
If, however, changing the routing and the reselling 
involve a surrender of the old bill to the railroad and 
the issuing of a new bill of lading not only on a new 



COMMERCIAL LAW 357 

route but with the purchaser from the consignee 
named as a new consignee, then the bank has thrown 
away everything, unless it actually obtains possession 
of the new bill, and even if it does it has only an in- 
ferior security. 

ACCOMMODATION BILLS.â€” Let us now 
enumerate the risks which a purchaser or a lender 
runs in dealing with bills of lading, even with order 
bills, and consider how these risks can be obviated and 
how far they are inherent in the nature of the busi- 
ness. The first risk is that the bill may have no goods 
behind it, because it was originally issued without any 
goods. It has been quite a common practice, at some 
points where there is competition for freight, to ac- 
commodate customers by issuing a bill of lading for 
goods before the goods were received. Suppose a 
seller in Chicago deals with a man in Boston; what 
the seller normally ought to do is to buy goods, and 
ship them, getting a bill of lading, then take the bill of 
lading to a bank and get money on the faith of that 
bill of lading. You will see that that method re- 
quires the seller to have had money or credit in the 
first place, in order to buy those goods to ship. It 
would be very much more convenient for him if he 
could reverse the order and get the money from the 
bank first, then buy the goods and then ship them; 
and the kindness of the railroad agent frequently has 
enabled him to do that. The railroad agent, trusting 
to the seller's word that he will ship goods to-morrow, 
issues a bill of lading to him for the goods which the 
seller promises to ship. The seller dashes around to 



358 COMMERCIAL LAW 

the bank, gets money and then buys the goods and 
ships them. He may carry on business in that way 
for a long time ; no trouble occurs, nobody knows any- 
thing about it until the seller either goes bankrupt or 
becomes dishonest and fails to ship the goods after 
he has got the bill of lading, and then somebody finds 
himself with a bill of lading for which no goods have 
ever been received. Such bills have been called "ac- 
commodation" bills of lading, issued by the railroad 
for the accommodation of the shipper. 

FICTITIOUS BILLS OF LADING.â€” In some 
cases the whole transaction is a fraud. In the case we 
have thus far been supposing, the railroad agent be- 
lieved the seller was going to ship goods, and the 
seller intended to do so, only he wanted the bill of 
lading first ; but money is so easily obtained, frequent- 
ly, on bills of lading, that sometimes a shipper and a 
railroad agent put their heads together and say, "Let's 
make a few bills of lading," and as a pure fraud the 
agent writes bills of lading. These may be called 
fictitious bills. They are not exactly forgeries, you 
will see, since they are drawn by the regular agent of 
the railroad on the regular railroad form. One who 
took such a bill as this, however, would be protected 
if the carrier were liable. Railroads are generally, 
and other carriers are generally, financially respon- 
sible, and therefore the great question that interests 
the holder of such a bill is, are the railroads liable in 
damages because no goods are behind the bill of lad- 
ing? It was held in an English case, seventy-five 
years ago, that in such a case the carrier was not liable 



COMMERCIAL LAW 359 

on the ground that the agent who wrote the bill was 
acting beyond the scope of his authority in signing a 
bill of lading when no goods had been received. That 
decision has been much criticized, and justly criti- 
cized, because the carrier has put that agent in a posi- 
tion to determine when bills of lading shall be issued 
and when not. Of course, the agent ought to exercise 
his choice properly, but if the carrier has given him 
the power it ought to be responsible for the results. 
Nevertheless, in a majority of the States of this 
country, and in the Supreme Court of the United 
States, the English case has been followed; and the 
carrier would be liable neither on an accommodation 
bill nor a fictitious bill where no goods were shipped. 
There have been some attempts to change this rule 
by statutes, and in some States there is a statute, the 
Uniform Bill of Lading Act, so called, which provides 
among other things that the carrier shall be liable in 
the case supposed; but the trouble is that bills of 
lading dealt with in one State will not generally orig- 
inate in that State. If a fictitious bill was issued in 
Chicago, although the bill named as a consignee a 
person in Boston, and was bought by a Boston bank, 
the liability of the carrier on that bill of lading would 
be determined by the law of Illinois. So, unless you 
have a satisfactory law where the bill originates, you 
will not be protected. Fortunately, the same statute 
has been passed in several States, and it is hoped that 
it will be in more. This, then, is the first risk, and the 
only way of obviating it is to have the law in satis- 
factory shape, passing a statute wherever it is neces- 



360 COMMERCIAL LAW 

sary, so as to make the carrier liable for the wrongful 
act of its agent in issuing a bill of lading when no 
goods have been received. 

GOODS BEHIND BILL OF LADING IN- 
FERIOR IN KIND OR QUALITY.â€” The second 
difficulty is somewhat analogous to the first. Sup- 
pose there are some goods behind the bill of lading 
but they are not of the quantity, quality or kind that 
the bill of lading specifies. This is a difficulty that 
cannot very well be wholly obviated. We may sup- 
pose that the goods originally were of defective qual- 
ity and kind, or that they became so. Suppose, first, 
that a number of barrels of sand are delivered to a 
railroad and they are marked barrels of sugar, and 
the carrier issues a bill of lading for so many barrels 
of sugar. Now, the purchaser of the bill of lading 
finds, when he comes to realize on his security, that he 
has got barrels of sand with a freight bill against them 
for more than they are worth. What can he do? Of 
course, he has a right of action against the fraudulent 
shipper, but perhaps the shipper has run away or is 
irresponsible. Is the carrier liable here? The answer 
to this is, no. In the first place, the bill of lading says, 
"Contents and condition of contents unknown," so 
that the carrier has expressly guarded against prom- 
ising that the barrels really contained sugar. And 
even aside from this clause, it has been held that the 
carrier is not liable for such a concealed defect. If, 
however, it was apparent when the carrier received 
the goods that they were not of the kind or quality 
named, then the carrier would be liable if it issued 



COMMERCIAL LAW 361 

a bill of lading without specifying the difficulty. 
Thus, if the bill of lading called for 100 barrels of 
sugar and there were 95, the carrier would be liable for 
the missing five. It has admitted it received 100, 
and has promised to deliver 100; it must do so or be 
liable. 

SHIPPER'S LOAD AND COUNT.â€” There is 
an exception to this last statement, however, in regard 
to one class of bills which are very common in some 
lines of trade; these are "shipper's load and count" 
bills. In many cases railroads build spur tracks to 
factories and run empty cars up to the factories, where 
the shipper loads the cars and himself writes out the 
bill of lading. An enormous fraction of the business 
of the country, consisting of the large shipments from 
factories, at any rate, is done in this way. The rail- 
road agent simply signs a bill of lading as it is pre- 
sented to him by the shipper who has made out the 
whole bill except the signature, and has loaded the 
car, the railroad agent seeing nothing of it. The 
railroad agent stamps across such a bill of lading, 
"Shipper's load and count." That means, "The ship- 
per loaded this car and counted the contents. We are 
not responsible, therefore, for the loading or the 
counting." The second great principle, in regard to 
lending money on bills of lading, is never to touch a 
shipper's load and count bill which obviously has not 
the responsibility of the carrier. You would have to 
rely wholly on the honesty of the shipper. The rail- 
roads, seeing that they are freed from liability on this 
form of bill, have sometimes, in some parts of the 



362 COMMERCIAL LAW 

country, thought it would be a good thing to stamp 
every bill, "Shipper's load and count." That is an 
injury to the shipper, because the banks do not like to 
take such bills of lading, and yet not infrequently he 
cannot do much about it. In fruit shipments from 
California that sort of thing has been very common. 

DESTRUCTION OF GOODS IN TRANSIT. 
â€” So much for defects arising at the time of shipment; 
but one may also have difficulties v^^hich arise after 
the shipment. Suppose the goods are absolutely de- 
stroyed in transit by any of a variety of causes. The 
owner of the bill of lading necessarily loses his secur- 
ity, unless under the bill the carrier is responsible for 
that particular kind of loss. But it may happen that 
the carrier is not responsible for that particular kind 
of loss. One may protect himself here, perhaps, by 
insurance of some kind. That would be the way to 
obviate this sort of risk, but if complete protection 
against this kind of risk is desired, the insurance 
ought to be not only against fire but against destruc- 
tion, or really against deterioration in any form. Of 
course, goods which are likely to depreciate in transit 
are not as good security as goods which are more dur- 
able. A cargo of bananas is not as good security as 
a cargo of grain. 

LACK OF TITLE IN SHIPPER.â€” A third risk, 
which any one who takes a bill of lading runs, is lack 
of title to the goods in the shipper. Suppose the 
shipper stole the goods and brought them to the car- 
rier and demanded and received an order bill of lading. 
That looks like as good a bill of lading as any, and the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 363 

goods may be all right, but the holder of the bill of 
lading cannot keep the goods. They still belong to 
the original owner from whom the shipper stole them. 
SPENT BILLS.â€” A fourth risk is that the bill 
of lading may be a "spent bill," as it is called. A spent 
bill is one where the goods have been delivered by the 
carrier at destination, but the bill of lading has not 
been taken up. A bill of lading is unlike a note in this 
respect â€” it has no date of maturity. When you buy a 
promissory note you can guess whether it has been 
dishonored or not, by whether the time for perform- 
ance has come or not ; but if a bill of lading for a cargo 
of goods is offered to you, you have no means of tell- 
ing whether the cargo arrived the day before or 
whether the goods have been removed. Of course, 
the carrier ought to take up an order bill of lading 
when the goods are delivered, and in the Uniform Bills 
of Lading Act that requirement is made, and the car- 
rier is made liable on the bill if it is left outstanding 
and is purchased by a bona fide purchaser for value, 
who supposes that the goods are still in transit. This 
trouble with spent bills is not so likely to arise as a 
corresponding difficulty with what may be called "par- 
tially spent bills." It is not uncommon for partial 
delivery to be made and the bill of lading still left in 
the hands of the holder. Commonly, when all the 
goods are delivered, the bill of lading is taken up, but 
when part is delivered the carrier does not feel justi- 
fied, and indeed is not justified, in demanding the sur- 
render of the bill. What ought to be done, of course, 
is to indorse on the bill of lading the fact that part of 



364 COMMERCIAL LAW 

the goods has been delivered, with a specification of 
the part. This also is required by the bill of lading 
statute, and a carrier is made liable for failure to in- 
dorse on a bill of lading the fact that part of the goods 
described therein has been delivered. 

LACK OF TITLE TO BILLS OF LADING.â€” 
A fifth risk, which one who buys or lends money on 
bills of lading runs, is the chance that the person from 
whom he takes a bill of lading may not have title to it. 
This risk is the same that one runs in regard to nego- 
tiable paper. If an indorsement is forged, or if for any 
reason the holder of a bill of lading â€” or for that mat- 
ter of a bill of exchange â€” cannot give a good title to 
it, one who purchases from him will not get a good 
title. 

MEANING OF NEGOTIABILITY.â€” The ex- 
tent of this risk depends somewhat on the degree of 
negotiability which is given to bills of lading, and 
requires an understanding of what negotiability 
means. Ordinarily, one who buys a contract right 
gets no better right than has the person from whom 
he buys it. On the other hand, though one who buys 
chattel property capable of delivery, like a horse or a 
book, does not get title if the person who sold it to 
him had no legal title, yet a purchaser does get a good 
title to such property if he buys, in good faith and for 
value, from a person who has legal title though not 
an equitable title. You will see this best by an illus- 
tration. If a fraudulent person has a contract right 
assigned to him by fraud, and then sells the contract 
right to a bona fide purchaser, the bona fide purchaser 



COMMERCIAL LAW 365 

gets no greater right than the fraudulent person has; 
in other words, he cannot collect on the claim which 
he has obtained. On the other hand, if a fraudulent 
person has assigned to him, by fraud, a horse or a 
book, the legal title to which was in the assignor, he 
has acquired the legal title, and though he is subject 
to an equity, as the phrase is, and the horse or the 
book could be taken away from him by the defrauded 
person, if he could act quickly enough, yet a purchaser 
for value, without notice of fraud, will get an inde- 
feasible legal and equitable title to the horse or the 
book. 

Negotiable paper â€” like bills of exchange and 
promissory notes â€” is subject to the same rule as the 
horse or book, and is not subject to the same rule as or- 
dinary contract rights; that is, a purchaser in good 
faith of an order bill of lading from a vendor having 
legal title thereto, will get title to it and to the goods 
behind it, in spite of the fact that the person from 
whom the bill of lading was bought had obtained title 
by fraud, and could have had the bill of lading, or the 
goods behind it, taken away from him by the person 
defrauded. 

Another feature of negotiability is that the terms 
of the instrument, on the face and back, are regarded 
as definitely showing the title. If the instrument is 
made to A's order, A has power by indorsement to 
give a good title, whatever may have been the reason 
the instrument was made payable to A, and even 
though it was agreed by the original parties that A 
should be merely an agent and have no title or right 



366 COMMERCIAL LAW 

to transfer. If the instrument is made out on its face 
to bearer, or is indorsed in blank by the person to 
whom it is made out on the face, anyone acting in good 
faith may treat the holder as the owner and acquire 
a good title from him, though in fact the holder may 
not have had a good title. Under the Uniform Bills 
of Lading Act, and under some other local statutes, 
bills of lading running to order are given full nego- 
tiability, but in many States they are only partially 
negotiable. 

INDORSEMENT OF BILLS OF LADING.â€” 
Order bills of lading need, for their negotiation, in- 
dorsement by the consignee, just as a promissory note 
needs indorsement by the payee. But there is one dif- 
ference between the indorsement of a bill of lading, it 
may be said in passing, and the indorsement of a prom- 
issory note. The indorser of a bill of lading incurs no 
liability by his indorsement. His indorsement is sim- 
ply a transfer. If it turns out that the bill of lading 
is not honored by the carrier, the holder of an indorsed 
bill of lading cannot come back on the indorser in the 
way that the holder of a promissory note can come 
back on the indorser if the maker fails to pay. 

FORGED BILLS OF LADING.â€” One final risk 
in regard to bills of lading is that the bill of lading 
may be forged or altered, and this has in practice 
proved the most serious risk of all. There have been, 
in times past, several sets of frauds created by forged 
bills of lading. One of the largest is known as the 
Knight-Yancey frauds which originated in Alabama. 
A cotton firm named Knight, Yancey & Co. forged a 



COMMERCIAL LAW 367 

quantity of bills of lading and obtained a very large 
amount of money from banks. A circumstance that 
renders forgery easier in the case of bills of lading 
than in the case of any other valuable document, such 
as a check or a stock certificate, is the carelessness 
with which bills of lading have been made out. It is 
really incredible, the carelessness with which this has 
been done. Documents which represent a value of 
many thousands of dollars are scribbled hastily, in 
pencil sometimes, on forms that are accessible to any- 
body. The forgeries that have taken place have called 
attention to this evil, and at the present time there is 
more care exercised in making out order bills than 
was the case a few years ago ; but even to-day an order 
bill of lading is made out with no special precautions 
against forgery. The forms can be obtained at any 
railroad station, and it is simply a question of copying 
writing, no devices of perforating or serial numbers 
or things of that sort being ordinarily used. 

DEVICES TO PREVENT FORGERY.â€” In 
order to meet this risk several devices have been sug- 
gested. One which has been urged upon Congress is 
to pay the railroads a special small fee for issuing or- 
der bills with the precautions that a stock certificate is 
issued. The railroad would take the blank from a 
numbered book and would punch and stamp it in such 
ways and with such countersigning that it would be 
very difficult to forge. That method has not found 
much favor with shippers because they dislike the 
extra expense. They get their order bills of lading for 
nothing now, and they want to continue to do so. 



368 COMMERCIAL LAW 

Another project is to make some sort of central clear- 
ing house to which shall be reported all order bills of 
lading as they are issued, so that it will be known 
whether there is outstanding a document correspond- 
ing to one that is offered to a bank for security. This 
method is to some extent in use. 

ALTERATION OF BILLS OF LADING.â€” 
Alteration of a genuine bill may be as damaging as the 
out and out forgery of a new one. This case occurred 
in Maryland some years ago : a man who had always 
been in good repute had a line of credit at the bank, 
where he kept, as security, bills of lading. He was 
allowed to change these as he wanted to, putting in 
sufficient collateral always to cover what he took out. 
The railroad and steamboat lines with which he did 
business neglected in some instances to take up the 
bills of lading which he presented for shipments. They 
habitually did not take up the straight bills, and that 
is not required by law, and sometimes they did not 
take up the order bills. When this man got hard 
pressed he took some old order bills, which he still 
had in his possession, and changed the dates ; then he 
took some straight bills which he had in his posses- 
sion and changed the date of those, and also added 
the words "or order'* to the name of himself as con- 
signee. Then, after indorsing those they looked good. 
He took those altered bills to his bank and substituted 
them for genuine bills, and when the fraud was found 
out the bank found itself with about $100,000 of al- 
tered bills of lading. The carrier was held liable on 
the order bills, even though they had been altered, 



COMMERCIAL LAW 369 

because it should have taken them up, but on the 
straight bills, which were a great part of the whole, 
the bank lost. Of course, they were still legally 
straight bills, although the holder had written "or 
order" on them. That fraud led to one protection 
being made in the uniform bill of lading recom- 
mended by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
The uniform form of order bill has the words "order 
of" printed in front of the blank for the consignee's 
name, so that a straight bill cannot be made into an 
order bill by adding "or order." Moreover, the differ- 
ence in color, between order and straight bills now 
gives a protection as to domestic bills; not as to for- 
eign bills, however. If a bill is altered fraudulently 
the bill is worth just as much and just as little as it 
would have been worth if no alteration had been 
made ; that is, the alteration, not the bill itself, is void. 
ATTACHMENT OF GOODS IN TRANSIT.â€” 
There is one other risk in regard to bills of lading 
which no longer exists where the Uniform Bills of 
Lading Act is in force, and that is seizure by attach- 
ment for the benefit of some creditor. The bills of 
lading act provides that when there is an order bill 
outstanding, against goods shipped by a carrier, there 
can be neither attachment by a creditor nor stoppage 
in transit by the seller if unpaid. Where the uniform 
statute has not been passed, the matter is not so clear. 
Undoubtedly one who purchased for value or lent 
money on an order bill would be protected against 
later attachments by creditors of the former owner 
of the bill; but if creditors of the former owner had 



370 COMMERCIAL LAW 

attached the goods prior to the transfer of the bill, the 
attachment would generally be held good, though the 
man purchasing or lending money on the bill knew 
nothing of the attachment. 

WAREHOUSE RECEIPTS ARE SIMILAR 
TO BILLS OF LADING.â€” To what has been said in 
regard to bills of lading a few words in regard to ware- 
house receipts may be added. Warehouse receipts are 
entirely similar in character to bills of lading, and 
what has been said in regard to them is, in general, 
applicable to warehouse receipts. There is a Uniform 
Warehouse Receipts Act which is similar in its provi- 
sions to the Uniform Bills of Lading Act, and the 
Warehouse Receipts Act has been enacted in a major- 
ity of the States. Warehouse receipts may be, in form, 
order or straight. They are simpler in form, ordi- 
narily, than bills of lading, because they do not have 
so many special stipulations and conditions, but in 
other respects they are practically identical. The risks 
that one who deals in them runs are the same in their 
nature as in the case of bills of lading. There is one 
circumstance, however, in regard to warehouse re- 
ceipts that gives one a better chance to protect him- 
self than in bills of lading. Warehouse receipts are 
generally used as collateral and for purchase and sale 
in the city where the goods are stored. It is therefore 
possible to telephone to the warehouseman or other- 
wise to assure oneself of the existence of the goods in 
a way that is not possible under the bill of lading, 
where the goods are in transit. The warehouse re- 
ceipt, even less than a bill of lading, has a day of ma- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 371 

turity. A bill of lading, as we have seen, has no par- 
ticular day on which it is evident to a purchaser that 
it has finished its work, and that is even more true in 
a warehouse receipt. The fact that a warehouse re- 
ceipt is pretty old does not necessarily show that the 
document is not a perfectly good document and that 
the goods are not there. 

OPEN RECEIPTS.â€” There is one way of doing 
business with warehouse receipts which is different 
from anything that takes place with bills of lading, 
and which has been a subject of criticism, and which 
deserves criticism ; this is the practice of issuing what 
are called open receipts. In an open receipt the ware- 
houseman acknowledges he has received a certain 
quantity of things of a certain sort, and will redeliver 
that quantity of things of that sort; but not neces- 
sarily the identical things that were deposited. It is 
contemplated that the depositor shall have the right 
to substitute from time to time, for the goods orig- 
inally deposited, other goods of like kind and quan- 
tity; that is, a receipt may be issued for 100 bales of 
burlap. The depositor who deals in burlap wants to 
use some of the bales that are in storage. He has 
pledged his warehouse receipt, which he originally 
received for the 100 bales of burlap, and he cannot 
surrender that, but he wants the warehouseman to let 
him take out 25 bales of the old burlap and put in 25 
bales of new, and that is sometimes allowed. It seems 
a very unsafe practice. It is unsafe, for one who lends 
on warehouse receipts, to allow the depositor and the 
warehouseman to agree between themselves as to 



372 COMMERCIAL LAW 

what shall be a sufficient substitution for goods which 
are the bank's collateral. Moreover, it is unsafe for the 
warehouseman, because if the holder of the warehouse 
receipt has not really consented to the substitution, 
or unless the form of warehouse receipt clearly shows 
that substitution is contemplated, the warehouseman 
would be liable to the holder of the receipt if the sub- 
stituted goods turn out to be inferior to those which 
were originally deposited. 

WAREHOUSEMAN IS A BAILEE FOR 
HIRE. â€” A warehouseman is a bailee for hire, and a 
bailee for hire is liable for neglect if the goods are 
destroyed or injured by his negligence. He is not 
an insurer. The ordinary bailee for hire is not sub- 
ject to the extraordinary liability to which a carrier is 
subjected while goods are in transit. 

SAFE DEPOSIT COMPANIES ARE 
BAILEES FOR HIRE.â€” There is one special kind 
of bailee, in regard to whom it may be worth while to 
say a few words particularly, and that is a safe de- 
posit company. It has been questioned whether a safe 
deposit company is properly a bailee of the goods in 
the boxes to which the safe deposit company does not 
have access. It is simply in control of the general 
premises, and, furthermore, the holder of the boxes 
cannot have access to what is inside the boxes with- 
out the assistance of the safe deposit company. There 
is, therefore, a sort of joint possession. The safe de- 
posit company and the depositor who hired the box 
have together the full control of the goods, but neither 
one of them alone has it. It has been suggested that 



COMMERCIAL LAW 373 

the safe deposit company is merely a sort of watch- 
man ; that it is guarding property of which it is not in 
possession. But it is doing a little more than guard- 
ing, and it is generally held to be a bailee for hire ; that 
means it must take reasonable care of the goods in 
its possession. 

LIABILITY OF SAFE DEPOSIT COMPA- 
NIES FOR LOSS OF GOODS.â€”There are a num- 
ber of cases, not a great many, but still some, where 
safe deposit companies have been sued for goods 
which were missing, or which the depositor sv/ore 
were missing, from his box. If the court or jury is 
convinced that the goods have been lost from the box, 
the burden of explanation as to how it happened would 
be upon the safe deposit company. The safe deposit 
company is liable for the acts of its servants and 
agents. Of course, then, carelessness in regard to 
duplicate keys of any of the boxes might render a 
safe deposit company subject to suit if loss occurs 
thereby. 

LIABILITY OF DEPOSITED GOODS TO 
GARNISHMENT.â€” One of the most important 
questions in regard to safe deposit companies is this : 
Are the goods in the safes subject to legal process? 
Suppose a safe deposit company is garnisheed (that 
is served with a trustee writ) in a suit against some 
one who has a box; can the company answer that it 
has no funds or goods of the defendant in its posses- 
sion? Yes, it may; it cannot control the goods and it 
may answer, no funds. One case, however, must be 
distinguished, and that is where a bank or a safe de- 



374 COMMERCIAL LAW 

posit company has a separate trunk or box of a de- 
positor in its possession. If it has that separate box, 
even though it is locked, and the bank has not the key, 
the bank cannot answer no funds; it must answer 
that it has a box the contents of which are unknown 
to it. A box, however, shut up in a safe deposit vault, 
that is, one of the regular tin safes, cannot be reached 
by the safe deposit company in the normal course of 
affairs, unless the depositor unlocks his lock. That is 
the reason for distinguishing between such a box and 
an ordinary box or trunk which is not itself enclosed 
in something, to which the bank or safe deposit com- 
pany does not have access. 

LIABILITY OF DEPOSITED GOODS TO 
ATTACHMENT.â€” Whether property in a safe de- 
posit company is liable on a writ of attachment in a 
suit against the owner, is not so clear. It has been 
held in one case that it is so liable, and that the officer 
has a right to go in and seize the goods. This will not 
often be attempted, however, because the officer will 
not know in what box the debtor might have goods, 
and the safe deposit company will not tell him. The 
company is certainly under no obligation to help the 
officer. The regular way for a creditor to get at the 
goods of his debtor, concealed in the safe deposit box, 
is by first making the debtor disclose on examination 
in court what property he has, and then getting an 
order from the court that the debtor shall turn over 
what he has disclosed. This he must do or be impris- 
oned until he does. There is only one difficulty 
with this remedy, and that is that the debtor may 



COMMERCIAL LAW 375 

have an infirm memory â€” in other words, he may com- 
mit perjury; he may have something in the box and 
not disclose the fact. 

SEARCH FOR STOLEN PROPERTY.â€” If 
stolen property were sought, a search warrant de- 
scribing the property might be presented to the safe 
deposit company, and it would have to permit the offi- 
cer of the law to make the search for the goods de- 
scribed, but only for goods described in the search 
warrant. There is a case in New York where, on a 
search warrant for certain articles, the officer of a safe 
deposit company allowed the officer of the law to make 
a general examination of goods in its possession, and 
to remove some bonds which were not specified in the 
search warrant. The safe deposit company was held 
liable. 

DEATH OF DEPOSITOR. â€” The question 
often arises : What is the situation on the death of the 
owner or renter of a safe? It is the same as in the case 
of the death of any bailor or depositor. The bailee 
must recognize the title only of the person who is 
appointed by law as the successor in interest to the 
deceased person. The safe deposit company has the 
right, and should exercise it, to demand proofs and 
identifications of persons who claim rights as repre- 
senting deceased persons. Sometimes a dispute arises 
between joint owners of a box. In that case the only 
safe course for a safe deposit company would be to 
recognize the right of none until it had been passed 
on by the court. What is called a bill of interpleader, 
to determine which one has the right, should be filed 



376 COMMERCIAL LAW 

in court, unless the conflicting interests can agree or 
one of them gives a bond to the company to insure its 
freedom from liability if it delivers the goods to him. 

SAFE DEPOSIT COMPANY HAS NO LIEN. 
â€” A safe deposit company has no lien on the contents 
of a box for anything due to it. In that respect it is 
different from an ordinary warehouseman and a car- 
rier, who have a lien on the goods in their possession 
for their charges. The reason is that a safe deposit 
company is not in such possession of the contents of 
a box as to give it a lien. If the renter of the box does 
not pay his bills, however, the company has the right 
to open the box and remove its contents, keeping them 
safe for the owner. 

GIFT OF GOODS IN A SAFE DEPOSIT 
BOX. â€” It was held in a case, decided in the State of 
Illinois, that the gift of the keys of a safe deposit box 
amounted to a valid gift of property in the box when 
made with that intention. In order to make a good 
gift there must be a valid delivery, and it was held 
that the delivery of the keys amounted to a symbolic 
delivery of the contents of the box. 

RIGHT OF SAFE DEPOSIT COMPANY TO 
SUE FOR GOODS WRONGFULLY TAKEN.â€” 
If goods are wrongfully removed from the box of a 
depositor, the safe deposit company has a right to 
reclaim them like any bailee, for it is the law that if 
goods are taken out of the hands of a carrier, ware- 
houseman or other bailee wrongfully, the bailee may 
reclaim the goods from the wrongdoer, and bring an 
action at law for them, not as owner, but because the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 377 

bailee has the right of possession to them while in his 
custody, and he may be liable if he lets them get into 
the hands of any one other than the true owner. 

LIABILITY OF SAFE DEPOSIT COMPA- 
NIES UNDER INHERITANCE TAX LAWS.â€” 
One case in regard to the Illinois inheritance tax law 
indicates an imposition of some burden on the safe 
deposit company. The company is required to notify 
the Attorney-General ten days before it allows access 
by the representative of a deceased person to his box, 
and under certain circumstances the safe deposit com- 
pany is required to retain, from the contents of the 
box, a sufficient amount to pay the tax, and is made 
liable if it fails to do so. This provision was held con- 
stitutional by the Supreme Court of Illinois, 



CHAPTER XII 



Bills and Notes 

HISTORY.â€” By the term "negotiable paper," we 
ordinarily mean promissory notes, bills of ex- 
change and checks. The law governing nego- 
tiable paper originated among the customs of mer- 
chants on the continent of Europe. It was gradually 
introduced into England, and its principles grudg- 
ingly recognized by the common law judges. There 
is no branch of law where the desirability of uni- 
formity is greater, as these documents pass from hand 
to hand like money, and travel from one State to an- 
other. Naturally, our first serious attempt at uni- 
form legislation was made in this branch of law, and 
in the year 1896, the Commissioners for Uniform 
Laws prepared and recommended for passage the 
Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law. To-day, every 
State, except Georgia, has passed the Act, as well as 
the District of Columbia, Alaska, Porto Rico and 
the Philippines. For convenience in this chapter, we 
shall hereafter refer to this Negotiable Instruments 
Act as the N. I. L. 

FORMS OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRU- 
MENTS. â€” It is essential to carry in mind the cus- 
tomary form of the negotiable instruments we have 
just mentioned. A promissory note is defined by the 
N. I. L. as follows: "A negotiable promissory note 
within the meaning of this act is an unconditional 
promise in writing made by one person to another

signed by the maker engaging to pay on demand, or 
at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain 
in money to order or to bearer." 

A bill of exchange is defined by the N. I. L. as fol- 
lows: "A bill of exchange is an unconditional order 
in writing addressed by one person to another, signed 
by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom 
it is addressed to pay on demand or at a fixed or deter- 
minable future time a sum certain in money to order 
or to bearer." 

A check is defined by N. I. L. as "a bill of ex- 
change drawn on a bank payable on demand." 

Other documents may be negotiable in form, such 
as the ordinary bearer corporation bonds, liberty 
bonds, certificates of stock, and bills of lading. The 
principles discussed in this chapter would apply, or- 
dinarily, to these documents, and are discussed more 
in detail in the chapters devoted to them which we 
have already considered. 

WHAT IS NEGOTIABILITY?â€” Negotiabil- 
ity has been defined as that quality whereby a bill, 
note, or check, passes freely from hand to hand like 
currency. In fact, all of these documents are substi- 
tutes for currency, and so far as is practicable, it is 
desirable that they should pass as freely as currency. 
Negotiability applies only to this branch of the law, 
while assignability applies to ordinary cases of con- 
tract law. 

ILLUSTRATIONS.â€” To illustrate the differ- 
ence between the two: Jones worked for the Balti- 
more & Ohio Railroad Co. He presented his bill of

COMMERCIAL LAW 383 

$100 to the proper official, and a check was issued by 
the railroad payable to the order of Jones for that 
amount. Jones took the check, indorsed it, and with it 
paid his grocery bill. The grocery man deposited the 
check in his bank, and was notified shortly thereafter 
that payment had been stopped on the check by the 
Baltimore & Ohio. They claimed a fraud had been 
committed, that Jones was overpaid $50, and, there- 
fore, they refused to honor the check. The grocery 
man, having taken this check in the usual course of 
business, is what we term a "holder in due course." 
The N. I. L. defines a holder in due course as: 

Section 52. "A holder in due course is a holder 
who has taken the instrument under the following 
conditions: (1) That it is complete and regular upon 
its face; (2) That he became the holder of it before it 
was overdue, and without notice that it had been pre- 
viously dishonored, if such was the fact; (3) That he 
took it in good faith and for value; (4) That at the 
time it was negotiated to him he had no notice of any 
infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of 
the person negotiating it." 

A holder in due course, then, would be entitled to 
collect the full $100 from the Baltimore & Ohio. This 
check is governed by the law of negotiability with the 
result which we have just indicated. Now change the 
facts a trifle. Jones presented his bill to the same offi- 
cer of the Baltimore & Ohio as before. The officer 
says that checks are made out regularly on the first 
of the month. It was the fifteenth, and Jones did not 
feel able to wait until the first of the next month. He 



384 COMMERCIAL LAW 

went to a friend and told him of his claim against 
the Baltimore & Ohio, and said: "I will assign this 
claim to you for $95, and then you can present the 
assignment, which I will draw up and sign, to the 
Baltimore & Ohio on the first of the month, and get 
the $100." His friend agrees and advances the money. 
When he presents the written assignment to the 
proper officer on the first of the month, he is told that 
the railroad has discovered that Jones' claim was 
really good for only $50, and that is all they will pay. 
Although his assignment reads for $100, he can col- 
lect only $50. This illustration is governed by the 
law of assignability, which applies to practically all 
contracts, apart from commercial paper. Under the 
rules of assignability, a person can assign no better 
claim than he has, or, as is sometimes said, the as- 
signee stands in the shoes of the assignor. Jones 
really had a claim of only $50 against the Baltimore & 
Ohio, although he claimed it was $100. He could as- 
sign no more than he really had. These two illustra- 
tions show the great difference in the result of the 
application of the two principles, negotiability and 
assignability. 

THE FORMAL REQUIREMENTS OF NE- 
GOTIABLE PAPER.â€” There are certain formalities 
which all negotiable paper must have. It must be in 
writing, and signed by the proper person. No form 
of writing is specified in the Act, and lead pencil, or 
even slate pencil, is as good as ink, except that in the 
two latter cases the ease with which these forms of 
writing may be altered makes them most undesirable 



COMMERCIAL LAW 385 

for use. But there is no law requiring the use of ink. 

MUST CONTAIN A PROMISE.â€” Every nego- 
tiable instrument must contain words of negotiabil- 
ity. These words are, "to order," "to bearer," "to 
holder" or their equivalent. "I promise to pay John 
Jones, $100," and signed "John Smith," is a promis- 
sory note, but not a negotiable promissory note, be- 
cause it lacks the words to "order" or "bearer," and 
is a document which would, therefore, pass by the law 
of assignability rather than the law of negotiability. 
In taking negotiable paper, therefore, it is always im- 
portant to see whether these words are present. If 
they are not, the holder will lose the peculiar advan- 
tage and rights which the holder in due course ac- 
quires by the law of negotiability. A promissory note 
must contain a promise and a bill of exchange must 
contain an unconditional order. An I. O. U. for $100 
signed "John Jones" is not a promissory note, be- 
cause there is no promise contained in such a docu- 
ment. 

UNCONDITIONAL PROMISE. â€” All nego- 
tiable documents must be payable without reference to 
any contingency. A note reads : "I promise to pay to 
the order of John Jones $100 when I attain my twenty- 
second birthday" and is signed by John Jones, now 
twenty-one. That is not a good note because the per- 
son may not live to be twenty-two. Even if he lives 
to become twenty-two the note is still non-negotiable, 
for when it was made the contingency existed. A bill 
of exchange, regular in form, but adding the expres- 
sion, "If the Republicans win the next congressional 



386 COMMERCIAL LAW 

election," is not negotiable. The one exception, as it 
might appear at first sight, is a negotiable document 
reading: "I promise to pay to the order of William 
White six months after death," etc. Such a promise 
is not contingent. Death will arrive at some time, al- 
though it may be uncertain just when. In the other 
illustrations the republicans might not win the con- 
gressional election, and the person might not become 
twenty-two. Again, all commercial paper must be 
made payable in money. "I promise to pay to the 
order of John Jones $100 worth of tobacco,'* is not 
negotiable. "I promise to pay to the order of John 
Jones $100 and fifty pounds of tobacco" is not negoti- 
able. In both cases, the medium of payment is some- 
thing other than money. 

INCEPTION OF THE INSTRUMENT AS 
AN OBLIGATION. â€” In our discussion of contracts, 
we made the statement that a legal intention to make 
a contract was necessary. The same is true in com- 
mercial paper. A man must intend legally to issue a 
negotiable instrument in order to be liable on one as 
maker or drawer. Thus, in the case of Walker v. Ebert, 
29 Wis. 94, the defendant, a German, unable to read 
and write English, was induced by the payee to sign 
an instrument, in the form of a promissory note, rely- 
ing on the false statement that it was a contract ap- 
pointing the defendant agent to sell a patent right. 
It was held that the defendant was not liable. The 
instrument, though complete in form, was not the 
defendant's note and the plaintiff acquired nothing 
by his purchase of the paper. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 387 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” We must contrast this 
with another situation. Suppose I hand you a paper 
with a promissory note printed on it, complete in 
every detail except your signature. I ask you to sign 
it. You sign the paper, without reading it over or 
knowing what it is, and give it back to me. I then 
transfer it to a person who takes it for value, in good 
faith, etc., or who is, in other words, a holder in due 
course. The question is, are you liable on such a 
document? The answer is, "Of course, you are." 
You may say, "I did not intend to sign a promissory 
note." The law answers you by saying, "You were 
careless in signing something which you did not read 
over, and one is presumed to intend the consequences 
of his own careless acts." Our German was in a dif- 
ferent situation. He was not careless. He could not 
read English and was obliged to rely upon someone 
to tell him what the document was, and, granting 
that he used due care in selecting a responsible per- 
son to explain to him the nature of the document, he 
had done all the law required. Had he been imposed 
upon, on several previous occasions, by the same per- 
son who told him what the document was, and in 
spite of that, had relied on him to explain this docu- 
ment, then, undoubtedly, the court would have held 
otherwise and he would have been liable on the 
ground that he must have intended the consequences 
of his negligent acts, he being deemed negligent 
when he trusts a person who had not only misrepre- 
sented things to him but had actually defrauded him 
several times. 



388 COMMERCIAL LAW 

DELIVERY. â€” A note found among the maker's 
papers, after his death, imposes no obligation either 
upon him or upon his estate. In other words, in addi- 
tion to the intentional signing of the document, to 
complete its validity, there must also have been what 
we call delivery. This is a passing out of the posses- 
sion of the maker or drawer, of the document, into 
the hands of some third party. Delivery may be made 
in three ways: (1) By intention; (2) By fraud; (3) By 
negligence. 

A VALID DELIVERY NECESSARY.â€” I hand 
you my promissory note and you take it. That, of 
course, is an intentional delivery. You tell me that 
you have a fine watch which I decide to buy, and I 
give you my promissory note in payment. After- 
wards, upon examining the watch, I find that it is 
worthless and entirely different from your description. 
You have secured the note from me in that case by 
fraud, or there is, as we say, a delivery procured by 
fraud. I am sitting on a bench in Central Park, and I 
take out of my pocket a completed promissory note 
and look at it and place it upon the bench. V/hen I 
leave I forget it and it stays there until someone comes 
along and picks it up. That is a delivery by negli- 
gence. All these forms of delivery are valid, making 
the documents good, some in the hands of all parties, 
others in the hands of the holder in due course only. 
The N. I. L. is so clear upon this matter that refer- 
ence must be made to sections 15 and 16. For this 
reason both of these sections are reproduced here in 
full: 



COMMERCIAL LAW 389 

Section 15. "Where an incomplete instrument has 
not been delivered it will not, if completed and negoti- 
ated, without authority, be a valid contract in the 
hands of any holder, as against any person whose sig- 
nature was placed thereon before delivery." 

Section 16. "Every contract on a negotiable in- 
strument is incomplete and revocable until delivery of 
the instrument for the purpose of giving effect there- 
to. As between immediate parties, and as regards a 
remote party other than a holder in due course, the de- 
livery, in order to be effectual, must be made either by 
or under the authority of the party making, drawing, 
accepting or indorsing, as the case may be ; and in such 
case the delivery may be shown to have been condi- 
tional, or for a special purpose only, and not for the 
purpose of transferring the property in the instru- 
ment. But where the instrument is in the hands of a 
holder in due course, a valid delivery thereof by all 
parties prior to him so as to make them liable to him 
is conclusively presumed. And where the instrument 
is no longer in the possession of a party whose signa- 
ture appears thereon, a valid and intentional delivery 
by him is presumed until the contrary is proved." 

DISTINGUISHING FEATURES.â€” It is very 
important to distinguish between these two sections. 
Let us take for illustration the famous case of Baxen- 
dale V. Bennett, 3 Q.B.Div. 525. Here the defendant 
wrote his signature as acceptor on several printed 
blank forms of bills of exchange and left them in a 
drawer of his desk. The blanks were stolen, filled out, 
and negotiated to the plaintiff, an innocent purchaser. 



390 COMMERCIAL LAW 

It was held that the plaintiff could not recover. The 
reason for this decision is that the document was in- 
complete and as the Act says: "Where an incomplete 
instrument has not been delivered it will not, if com- 
pleted and negotiated, without authority, be a valid 
contract in the hands of any holder, as against any per- 
son whose signature was placed thereon before de- 
livery." On the other hand, if I leave in my safe, 
checks which I have signed and made out in full and 
they are payable to bearer, although a thief breaks in 
and steals the checks from the safe, those documents 
will be valid in the hands of a holder in due course. 
The reason here is that although there has been no 
delivery, either by intention or by fraud or by negli- 
gence, nevertheless, the Negotiable Instruments Act 
has extended this theory of delivery, even further 
than the law went before the Act was passed, and says 
that when the document is in the hands of a holder 
in due course, a delivery is conclusively presumed. 

CONSIDERATION.â€” Another essential in the 
inception of the instrument is consideration. We have 
already discussed this topic in the chapter on con- 
tracts. We made the statement at the beginning of 
this chapter that the law of negotiable paper came 
from the continent of Europe and was grudgingly re- 
ceived by the courts of England. The law of negoti- 
able paper on the continent of Europe did not have 
any idea of consideration, and this is one reason why 
the law was reluctantly admitted to the English com- 
mon law and explains the reason now why we have 
the doctrine of consideration in negotiable paper. It 



COMMERCIAL LAW 391 

would not be safe for the student to accept all we have 
said in regard to consideration in the chapter on con- 
tracts and apply it to negotiable paper. The differ- 
ence is at once apparent when you read Sections 24 
and 28 of the Negotiable Instrument Act which read: 

Section 24. **Every negotiable instrument is 
deemed prima facie to have been issued for a valuable 
consideration; and every person whose signature ap- 
pears thereon to have become a party thereto for 
value." 

Section 28. "Absence or failure of consideration 
is a matter of defence as against a person not a holder 
in due course." 

So, we see, that in the general law of contracts, 
consideration is absolutely essential to a binding con- 
tract but in the law of negotiable paper, consideration 
is not absolutely essential except when you are deal- 
ing with the immediate parties. An illustration will 
explain this. I wish to make you a present on your next 
birthday which is January 12. To-day, September 15, 
I give you my promissory note due on your birthday 
for $50. This is to be my present to you. You take 
the note and then hold it until your birthday arrives 
and I do not pay it. Then you sue me on the note. 
You cannot recover anything because there was no 
consideration for the note and the absence of consid- 
eration is a perfectly good defence between you and 
me, whom the law calls the immediate parties. But, 
suppose, instead of doing this, you had kept the note 
about six weeks and then had taken it to your bank 
and asked them if they would discount the note for 



392 COMMERCIAL LAW 

you and they had done so, taking it in absolutely good 
faith. They know me to be a responsible party, so 
they are willing to accept my promissory note. They 
knev/ you and they presumed that you had taken the 
note for a valuable consideration although, as a matter 
of fact, it was a gift to you. Under the circumstances, 
the bank is a holder in due course and when the note 
becomes due, if I do not pay, the bank will sue me and 
will collect from me because, as the Act says, "the 
failure of consideration is a matter of defence as 
against any person not a holder in due course." But 
the bank is a holder in due course. 

ACCEPTANCE OF BILLS OF EXCHANGE. 
â€” The holder of a bill of exchange will take it, soon 
after receiving it, to the drawee, the person upon 
whom it is drawn, for his acceptance. The drawee 
will accept it by writing across the face of it "Ac- 
cepted," signing his name and perhaps adding "Pay- 
able at the First National Bank." A form of bill of ^ 
exchange, duly accepted, will be found elsewhere in 
this chapter. The Act provides that the acceptance 
must be in writing and signed, either on the document 
itself or on a separate piece of paper attached to the 
document. As soon as the drawee accepts the bill, 
he then becomes known, not as the drawee but as 
the acceptor and he is the party primarily liable on the 
bill, that is, he assumes responsibility for its payment. 
The holder has a right to demand an acceptance for 
the full amount of the bill and may refuse to take an 
acceptance for a less amount. It is not always possible 
for the drawee to know whether he has sufficient funds 



COMMERCIAL LAW 393 

to justify an acceptance, and so the Act gives him 
twenty-four hours within which to make up his mind. 
During that time the holder is obliged to wait without 
taking any further action. Just as a conditional prom- 
ise to pay money is not a good promissory note, just 
so a conditional acceptance is not looked upon as an 
acceptance which a party is obliged to take. There 
are, however, occasionally times when a person is will- 
ing to take a conditional acceptance. For example, I 
hold a bill of exchange for $1,000. There are three or 
four indorsers upon it and I take it to the drawee to 
have him accept. He will not accept for more than 
$500. Now I feel that the drawer and all of the in- 
dorsers are financially irresponsible and I would rather 
have the acceptance of the drawee for $500 than noth- 
ing. I am willing to take it. The question comes up 
as to the effect of this upon the other parties, the draw- 
er and the indorsers. The Act covers that fully and 
it is important that it be kept in mind : 

Section 142. "The holder may refuse to take a 
qualified acceptance, and if he does not obtain an un- 
qualified acceptance, he may treat the bill as dis- 
honored by non-acceptance. Where a qualified ac- 
ceptance is taken, the drawer and indorsers are dis- 
charged from liability on the bill, unless they have ex- 
pressly or impliedly authorized the holder to take a 
qualified acceptance, or subsequently assent thereto. 
When the drawer or indorser receives notice of a quali- 
fied acceptance, he must, within a reasonable time, 
express his dissent to the holder, or he will be deemed 
to have assented thereto." 



394 COMMERCIAL LAW 

NEGOTIATION.â€” If negotiable paper is a sub- 
stitute for money, it follows that its most distinguish- 
ing characteristic is the fact that it may be transferred 
from one owner to another. This transfer is made in 
one of two ways. It may be by operation of law, or 
by act of the parties. By operation of law, we refer to 
such a case as where a person dies and his commercial 
paper then becomes the property of his administrator 
or executor. In other words, the law transfers the 
paper to the deceased persons's legal representative. 
The other case, the transfer by the act of the parties 
is, of course, the ordinary case and the one we shall 
consider here. The sections in the Negotiable Instru- 
ments Act which discuss this matter are so clear that 
we can do no better than insert them in full at this 
time: 

Section 30. "An instrument is negotiated when 
it is transferred from one person to another in such a 
manner as to constitute the transferee the holder 
thereof. If payable to bearer it is negotiated by de- 
livery; if payable to order it is negotiated by the in- 
dorsement of the holder completed by delivery." 

Section 3 1 . *'The indorsement must be written on 
the instrument itself or upon a paper attached thereto. 
The signature of the indorser, without additional 
words, is a sufficient indorsement." 

Section 32. "The indorsement must be an in- 
dorsement of the entire instrument. An indorsement 
which purports to transfer to the indorsee a part only 
of the amount payable, or which purports to transfer 
the instrument to two or more indorsees severally, 



COMMERCIAL LAW 395 

does not operate as a negotiation of the instrument. 
But where the instrument has been paid in part, it 
may be indorsed as to the residue." 

NEGOTIATION BY INDORSEMENT.â€” Ref- 
erence should be made to the several kinds of negotia- 
tion by indorsement. We have first the blank indorse- 
ment. There the person to w^hom the document is 
payable simply v^^rites his name on the back in the 
same way as it appears on the front. That is, if John 
Jones is the payee, he writes his name across the back 
of the instrument "JOHN JONES." Next, there is 
the special indorsement. John Jones, in this case, is 
the payee and wishes to transfer the note to John 
Wanamaker. He writes across the back, "pay to the 
order of John Wanamaker" and signs his name, 
JOHN JONES. A restrictive indorsement is one 
where the further negotiation of the instrument is 
limited or restricted altogether. For example, the 
payee writes across the back "Pay to the order of 
John Jones only." That restricts the further negotia- 
tion of the instrument. Another form that is com- 
monly used is in depositing checks in the bank in your 
own account ; usually you indorse "for collection" and 
sign your name, or you indorse "for deposit only" and 
sign your name. This form of indorsement simply 
constitutes the bank your agent to make collection, 
but not for any other purpose except that the Act now 
authorizes a bank to begin suit to collect on a docu- 
ment indorsed in that way. Another form of indorse- 
ment, known as the qualified indorsement, is frequent- 
ly used in the case where you wish to indorse without 



396 COMMERCIAL LAW 

incurring the usual liability of the indorser. This is 
done by adding under your name the expression "with- 
out recourse." This does not mean, as is commonly 
supposed, that you are free from all liability as an in- 
dorser. We shall refer to this later. 

THE HOLDER IN DUE COURSE.â€” As we 
have seen, the distinguishing feature of the law of 
commercial paper is negotiability as distinguished 
from assignability. The principles of negotiability are 
designed very largely for the protection of the person 
whom we call the holder in due course. It is essential 
then to bear in mind the condition under which a per- 
son becomes such. Section 52 of the Act defines a 
holder in due course as follows : 

Section 52. "A holder in due course is a holder 
who has taken the instrument under the following 
conditions: (1) That the instrument is complete and 
regular upon its face; (2) That he became the holder 
of it before it was overdue, and without notice that it 
had been previously dishonored, if such was the fact; 
(3) That he took it in good faith and for value; (4) 
That at the time it was negotiated to him he had no 
notice of any infirmity in the instrument or defect in 
the title of the person negotiating it." Section 57 de- 
fines what the rights of this holder in due course are: 

Section 57. "A holder in due course holds the in- 
strument free from any defect of title of prior parties, 
and free from defences available to prior parties 
among themselves, and may enforce payment of the 
instrument for the full amount thereof against all par- 
ties liable thereon." 



COMMERCIAL LAW 397 

It is clear, then, that by this section, the Act 
means that the holder in due course takes free of per- 
sonal defences, although he does not take free of ab- 
solute defences. It simply remains for us to consider 
briefly what is meant by a personal defence and what 
is meant by an absolute defence. We have already il- 
lustrated this in one of our cases where the note was 
a present. In this case, there was no consideration 
for the note. The boy to whom it was given could not 
recover, whereas when he transferred it to an innocent 
third party, a holder for value, he could recover. Thus 
we say, failure of consideration is a personal defence. 
Again, some person steals my check book, fills out a 
check, and forges my name. The check is then taken 
and finally gets into the hands of a person who is 
strictly a holder in due course. He could not recover 
on it, however, because forgery is a real defence. That 
is, no one can hold me liable on my forged check. The 
ordinary illustration of real or absolute defences are 
infancy, lunacy, illegality and sometimes fraud. Other -^ 
defences are generally personal defences and do not^^^ 
affect the holder in due course. To put it another way, 
a real defence is good against the whole world ; a per- 
sonal defence is available only against such as are notJ 
holders in due course. -^ 

LIABILITY OF PARTIESâ€” The parties pri- 
marily liable on negotiable documents are, on a note, 
the maker; on a bill of exchange, the acceptor; and 
on a check, the drawer. The liability of these three 
parties is most concisely stated in Sections 60, 61, 62, 
as follows : 






\ 



398 COMMERCIAL LAW 

Section 60. "The maker of a negotiable instru- 
ment by making it engages that he will pay it accord- 
ing to its tenor, and admits the existence of the payee 
and his then capacity to indorse." 

Section 61. "The drawer by drawing the in- 
strument admits the existence of the payee, and his 
then capacity to indorse; and engages that on due 
presentment the instrument will be accepted or paid, 
or both, according to its tenor, and that if it be dis- 
honored and the necessary proceedings on dishonor 
be duly taken, he will pay the amount thereof to the 
holder, or to any subsequent indorser who may be 
compelled to pay it. But the drawer may insert in the 
instrument an express stipulation negativing or limit- 
ing his own liability to the holder.*' 

Section 62. "The acceptor by accepting the in- 
strument engages that he will pay it according to the 
tenor of his acceptance; and admits: (1) The existence 
of the drawer, the genuineness of his signature, and 
his capacity and authority to draw the instrument; 
and, (2) The existence of the payee and his then ca- 
pacity to indorse." 

INDORSERS' LIABILITY.â€” We have not yet 
considered the question of the liability of persons who 
transfer negotiable documents. Indorsements may 
be made, as we have said, in two ways : either by in- 
dorsing the document, or if it is payable to bearer, by 
delivering it without indorsement. The liability of 
these two parties is stated in the Negotiable Instru- 
ments Act in Sections 65 and 66 in the following 
language: 



COMMERCIAL LAW 399 

Section 65. "Every person negotiating an instru- 
ment by delivery or by a qualified indorsement, v^^ar- 
rants: (1) That the instrument is genuine and in all 
respects what it purports to be; (2) That he has a 
good title to it; (3) That all prior parties had capacity 
to contract; (4) That he has no knowledge of any fact 
which would impair the validity of the instrument or 
render it valueless. But when the negotiation is by 
delivery only, the warranty extends in favor of no 
holder other than the immediate transferee. The pro- 
visions of subdivision three of this section do not ap- 
ply to persons negotiating public or corporation se- 
curities other than bills and notes." 

Section 66. "Every indorser who indorses with- 
out qualification, warrants to all subsequent holders 
in due course: (1) The matters and things mentioned 
in subdivision one, two and three of the next preced- 
ing section; and (2) That the instrument is at the 
time of his indorsement valid and subsisting. And, 
in addition, he engages that on due presentment, it 
shall be accepted or paid, or both, as the case may be, 
according to its tenor, and that if it be dishonored, and 
the necessary proceedings on dishonor be duly taken, 
he will pay the amount thereof to the holder, or to any 
subsequent indorser who may be compelled to pay it." 

QUALIFIED INDORSEMENT. â€” Section 65 
speaks of delivery by qualified instrument. You will 
remember that we have already mentioned the in- 
dorsement in the form "without recourse." This is a 
qualified indorsement. The kind of liability a person 
incurs who indorses in that way is set forth in Sec- 



400 COMMERCIAL LAW 

tion 65. This is important because the layman as- 
sumes that in indorsing "without recourse" one means 
to incur no liability as indorser. Such is not the case. 
Reread section 65, which covers the indorsement 
without recourse. There is liability for the things 
mentioned therein. Then in section 66, the last para- 
graph, you will notice that every indorser, who in- 
dorses without qualification "engages that on due 
presentment, it shall be accepted or paid, or both, as 
the case may be, according to its tenor, and that if it be 
dishonored, and the necessary proceedings on dis- 
honor be duly taken, he will pay the amount thereof 
to the holder." This does not mean that the indorser 
will always pay, but only if the necessary steps are 
taken. We shall consider what these necessary steps 
are when we take up the subject of "protest." 

CHECKS. â€” A check is simply a bill of exchange 
drawn on a bank and payable on demand. Therefore, 
the general principles which we have been laying 
down, in regard to bills of exchange and other nego- 
tiable paper, apply to checks, although, of course, the 
check is a more recent development in the law of 
commercial paper than the other two forms, namely, 
the promissory note and the bill of exchange. Section 
186 of the Act reads: "A check must be presented for 
payment within a reasonable time after its issue or 
the drawer will be discharged from liability thereon 
to the extent of the loss caused by the delay." 

HOLDER OF CHECK.â€” It is important to re- 
member that the holder of a check has no right against 
the bank. Thus, if I hold John Rockefeller's check, 



COMMERCIAL LAW 401 

drawn on the Institute National Bank, and I present 
it to the bank and the bank refuses to pay it for no 
reason at all, or for a purely arbitrary reason, I can- 
not sue the bank. The only thing I can do is to seek 
to get the money on the check from Mr. Rockefeller 
personally. This is because the drawing of a check is 
not the assignment of so much money to the payee 
named in the check. Of course, Mr. Rockefeller 
might sue his bank for failure to honor his check if 
it refuses to pay it to me for no valid reason. One fur- 
ther fact is important. When a holder of a check 
procures it to be certified by the bank, that releases all 
indorsers and also the drawer. And so, if I have a 
check drawn by Mr. Rockefeller and indorsed by six 
millionaires and I take that to the bank and have them 
certify it and then the bank fails, I have lost every- 
thing if the bank never pays anything to a depositor. 
By getting it certified I release Mr. Rockefeller and 
all of the indorsers. 

THE MEANING OF PROTEST.â€” Protest is 
often used broadly to signify any dishonor of a nego- 
tiable instrument, but, of course, properly it means 
presentment by a notary, and his certification that an 
instrument has been presented for payment and has 
been dishonored. Protest is only necessary in regard 
to foreign bills. A foreign bill is one which is drawn 
in one State and payable in another. For this purpose 
the different States of the Union are foreign to each 
other. A bill drawn in New York payable in Boston 
is as much a foreign bill for this purpose as one drawn 
in England payable here. 



402 COMMERCIAL LAW 

WHAT MAY BE PROTESTED.â€” Though pro- 
test is not necessary for any other negotiable instru- 
ment except foreign bills of exchange, including for- 
eign checks, it is convenient frequently to protest 
other negotiable instruments. The law provides that 
protest may be made of other negotiable instruments, 
and the certificate of protest is evidence in such cases, 
as well as in the case of foreign bills of exchange, of 
the facts which it states, namely, that the instrument 
has been duly presented and notice given. Statements 
in a certificate of protest, however, whether of foreign 
bills or of other instruments, are not conclusive evi- 
dence of the facts which they state. They are some 
evidence, but it may be shown by other evidence that 
the instrument was not presented, or was not pre- 
sented at the time the certificate asserts, or that the 
notice was not given as therein asserted. 

SUGGESTIONS FOR DRAWING NEGOTIA- 
BLE PAPER. â€” Very few suggestions are necessary 
in drawing checks. We almost always use the printed 
form. The only thing to be careful about is to draw 
lines through the blank spaces so that a check written 
for $70 may not have something else written be- 
fore the word seventy, thereby raising the amount 
to, say, One thousand seventy, and the figures, 
because they are not near the dollar sign, corre- 
spondingly raised. The promissory note is frequently 
drawn by the parties without any printed form. In 
order to be negotiable, the note must bear the words 
"or order," or "bearer"; otherwise, it would not be 
negotiable, and would pass by the law of assignability 



COMMERCIAL LAW 403 

without any of the advantages accruing to negotiable 
paper. The draft, or bill of exchange, is the docu- 
ment which the average layman is the least familiar 
with, and before drawing one, a printed form should 
be secured or a book on negotiable paper be consulted. 
NEGOTIABILITY.â€” Care should be taken in 
the indorsement of any negotiable paper. The in- 
dorsement in blank, that is, simply writing your name 
upon the paper on the back, is the one commonly 
used, but is a dangerous one to use, if there is any 
possibility of the paper being lost or stolen. For ex- 
ample, A has a promissory note payable to his order, 
and he simply writes his name across the back and 
mails it to a person who has agreed to accept it in 
payment of a bill A owes him. The letter is lost, gets 
into the hands of X, who opens it and takes the note. 
Of course, the note is no good to X. X, however, 
takes the note to someone and persuades that person 
to discount the note for him. That person does it in 
good faith, believing X came by the note rightfully. 
The discounter is therefore a holder in due course, and 
he would be able to collect on the note. What A 
should have done, when he sent the note to his friend 
John Brown, was to have indorsed it specially, "Pay 
to the order of John Brown, A." Again, a person who 
is collecting some money for his friend receives a 
check payable to his order. He wants to turn the 
check over to his friend, and indorses it by a special 
indorsement. "When the friend tries to collect on the 
check, it is returned "no funds." The friend now may 
hold the person responsible who indorsed the check, 



404 COMMERCIAL LAW 

because an indorser guarantees the payment of the 
instrument if the proper steps be taken to fix his li- 
ability. Ordinarily, of course, we wish an indorser to 
assume this liability, but in this particular case there 
was no reason why this man should have indorsed the 
check in that way. He could have indorsed it, and 
added to his signature the words "without recourse," 
which would have relieved him from paying the in- 
strument if the drawer did not pay it. 



CHAPTER XIII 



Torts and Crimes 

TORT, CONTRACT, AND CRIME DISTIN- 
GUISHED. â€” We have already discussed con- 
tracts in detail. The fundamental idea of con- 
tracts is that the obligation of a contract is voluntarily 
assumed. Although it might be difficult, at least 
theoretically, I may take the position that I will not 
enter into any contractual relationship with anyone 
for a month. I could do this legally, if I were willing 
to put up with the annoyance which I would probably 
suffer. But suppose I take the position that I will as- 
sault Jones and I will not pay him any damages for 
the injuries occasioned by my assault. My position 
would be wholly untenable. The contract obligation 
is voluntarily assumed. The law imposes the obliga- 
tions or duties which exist in torts, and I must ob- 
serve those duties whether I wish to or not. Similarly, 
one must observe all of the criminal law of the jurisdic- 
tion where he is, whether he will or not. In fact, ig- 
norance of the law is no excuse. A man may even 
commit a crime, although he did not know there was a 
law prohibiting the act. Again, in the definition of a 
tort, we shall find the expression, "breach of duty im- 
posed by lav/." A man arrives home late at night. He 
finds a person suffering from exposure at his front 
door. The person asks to be taken in and lodged for 
the night, but the householder refuses to take him in, 
and the man contracts pneumonia from exposure. In 

405 



406 COMMERCIAL LAW 

this case the householder is not liable. There is no 
duty imposed by law to be your brother's keeper. 
There may be a moral obligation in the case just cited, 
but not a legal one. 

JURISDICTION. â€” There is another way in 
which a criminal action is sometimes different from an 
action in contract or an action in tort. A suit on a 
contract may be brought in any court where jurisdic- 
tion over the parties may be secured. For example, 
A and B make a contract in New York. The contract 
is broken, and six months later, A and B are both in 
Galveston, Texas. Either party could sue the other 
in the Texas court on the broken contract. The same 
is true in regard to most tort actions. A slanders B 
in New York. A little later both are in San Fran- 
cisco, California. B could sue A in a California court 
for slander. A criminal prosecution, however, must 
always be brought in the State where the crime is 
committed, and generally in that very county of the 
State. Hence, if A murders B in Kings County, New 
York, the trial could not, under any circumstances, be 
held in Essex County, New Jersey, for no New Jersey 
court would have jurisdiction over an offense com- 
mitted in New York, because the wrong is done to the 
people of the State of New York, and not to the people 
of the State of New Jersey. 

TORT DEFINED.â€” It has been stated by the 
Court of Appeals of New York that no satisfactory 
definition of a tort can be found. It is easier, perhaps, 
to explain to the layman the meaning of the term 
"tort" by simply enumerating such things as are torts. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 407 

For example, assault and battery is a tort, and so are 
libel, slander, false imprisonment, malicious prosecu- 
tion, fraud, deceit, and negligence. Bigelow*s defini- 
tion is perhaps least objectionable of all of the defini- 
tions. He defines a tort as a breach of duty imposed 
by municipal law, for which a suit of damages will lie. 
Every tort involves the violation of a duty owed to the 
individual. For example, A owes to B the duty not 
to attempt with force to harm his person, or to hit 
him, or to touch him intentionally, or recklessly. The 
violation of this duty to B, by A, constitutes the tort 
of assault and battery. Again, A owes to B the duty 
not to injure B's reputation, either by spoken word or 
by written word, so long as B has done nothing to for- 
feit this right to a good reputation. The violation of 
this duty, on the part of A, constitutes the tort of libel 
or slander. So, then, it is easy to see why libel, for 
example, is a tort. It is a breach of duty which the law 
imposes upon A for which B may sue and recover 
damages if he is injured. The same with assault and 
battery, and the various other torts. 

CRIME DEFINED.â€” A tort, as we have indi- 
cated, is a breach of duty owed by A to B. A crime is 
also a breach of duty, but in this case, A is an individ- 
ual citizen, and B is a sovereign State. C murders D. 
When C is prosecuted, the action will read, "The peo- 
ple of the State of New York against C." In other 
words, the crime is a wrong to the State, and so a 
crime has been defined as an act or omission which is 
forbidden by law, to which a punishment is annexed, 
and which a State prosecutes in its own name. Mur- 



408 COMMERCIAL LAW 

der, manslaughter, arson and forgery are all crimes. 
We may correctly also add assault and battery, thus 
suggesting the fact that the same act may be both a 
crime and a tort, because the assault is a wrong 
against the individual and against the State. The in- 
dividual will sue in a civil court, to recover pecuniary 
damages, in an ordinary suit of tort, while the State, 
for the same offense, through the district attorney's or 
prosecutor's office, will criminally proceed against the 
guilty party. We shall now consider briefly some of 
the more important torts and crimes. 

ASSAULT AND BATTERY.â€” Assault is an at- 
tempt, real or apparent, to do injury to the person of 
another. Battery is a completed assault. It is not 
necessary that a person have the actual ability to 
carry out the threat to constitute an assault. For ex- 
ample, to point an unloaded revolver at a person is an 
assault. While the definition might convey the im- 
pression that force was necessary, this is not strictly 
true, because deception sometimes may be the equiva- 
lent of force. For example: Assault and battery is 
committed where a person administers a drug to some- 
one under the belief that he is taking an entirely dif- 
ferent kind of drug. Certain assaults, although tech- 
nically such, are excusable or justifiable. Formerly a 
school teacher had the right of corporal punishment 
without being liable for assault and battery. By 
statute this right is generally taken away now. A 
parent, however, may inflict corporal punishment on 
his child without any civil liability. Courts generally 
assign as the reason for this, the fact that it would not 



COMMERCIAL LAW 409 

be conducive to the welfare of the family to have chil- 
dren sue their parents, and the further fact that the 
child's rights are protected by giving him the right to 
have his parent arrested and punished criminally for 
an assault. While it was held formerly that a husband 
had the right to beat his wife, no modern court has up- 
held this view. 

SELF-DEFENSE.â€” Another case where assault 
is justified is in the case of self-defense. It is common 
saying that a man's house is his castle, and the right 
of self-defense is founded on the right of self-preserva- 
tion. So that it follows that a man may use force in 
protecting both himself and his property. A greater 
amount of force is ordinarily permitted in the protec- 
tion of the person than of property. In using force, 
however, such force only as is reasonably necessary 
may be used. For example, a man attempts to take 
my watch from my pocket. I strike his arm to pre- 
vent it, and do so successfully. Thereafter, as soon 
as the man's back is turned, I jump on him and assault 
him, injuring him severely. I would be liable in this 
case because more force than is necessary for the pro- 
tection of my property was used. 

LIBEL AND SLANDER.â€” These two terms are 
frequently combined under the one term of defama- 
tion which is defined as a false imputation upon one's 
character or reputation. Slander is oral defamation, 
and libel is written defamation. The action of slander 
is very technical. Perhaps there is no better summary 
than that given by the United States Supreme Court 
in the case of Pollard v. Lyon, 91 U. S. 225, as to 



410 COMMERCIAL LAW 

what statements are slanderous per se. "Slander," 
the court says, "may be divided into five classes, as fol- 
lows: (1) Words falsely spoken of a person which im- 
pute to the party the commission of some criminal of- 
fense involving moral turpitude, for which the party, if 
the charge is true, may be indicted and punished. 
(2) Words falsely spoken of a person which impute 
that the party is infected with some contagious dis- 
ease, where, if the charge is true, it would exclude the 
party from society ; or (3) Defamatory words falsely 
spoken of a person, which impute to the party unfit- 
ness to perform the duties of an office or employment 
of profit, or the want of integrity in the discharge of 
the duties of such an office or employment. (4) De- 
famatory words falsely spoken of a party which preju- 
dice such party in his or her profession or trade. 
(5) Defamatory words falsely spoken of a person, 
which, though not in themselves actionable, occasion 
the party special damage." A libel is any writing, pic- 
ture, print or effigy which tends to hold one up to the 
contempt, scorn, ridicule, or disgrace of his fellow 
men. We see then, that many statements which would 
not be slanderous would be libelous. 

PRINCIPLES COMMON TO BOTH LIBEL 
AND SLANDER. â€” Certain principles are common 
to both libel and slander. There must be a publica- 
tion in either case. To say to a school teacher, in a 
room where he and the speaker are the only persons 
present, that he is a fool, would not be slanderous. 
There is no publication. To write a letter to a minis- 
ter calling him a thief and a crook would not be libel- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 411 

ous because there would be no publication. After he 
had opened the letter and read it, should he show it 
to any of his friends, he would have made the publica- 
tion, and impliedly have consented to its publication. 
Whether to send statements like this on a postal card 
constitutes a publication or a libel is an open question, 
as also is the question whether the dictation of false 
statements to a person's stenographer constitutes pub- 
lication to some third person. 

PRIVILEGE. â€” Certain clearly slanderous or 
libelous statements may, nevertheless, not be action- 
able, because they are absolutely or qualifiedly privi- 
leged. Such is the case of any speech made by a mem- 
ber of Congress, or a member of the State Legislature 
on the fioor of the legislative hall. Such statement, 
however, made from the stump during a political cam- 
paign, would not be privileged. The first is what we call 
an absolute privilege. There is a certain class of privi- 
lege which we speak of as qualified privilege. News- 
papers, for example, are permitted to comment by way 
of criticism on any matters of current interest, pro- 
vided a reasonable limit is not exceeded. It would not 
be permissible for a newspaper to pick out John Jones, 
a wholly retiring and inconspicuous citizen of a town, 
and make statements about him which hold him up to 
ridicule, because the public welfare does not call for 
such action. However, were John Jones running for 
public office, it v^^ould be proper for a newspaper to 
make comment upon his record, and such statements 
would have a qualified privilege, although subjecting 
him to ridicule. A member of the legislature on the 



412 COMMERCIAL LAW 

floor of the legislature could make statements con- 
cerning the same John Jones and never be liable be- 
cause of his absolute privilege. We must assume, 
that, with each case mentioned, the statement made is 
false, in order to have it constitute libel or slander. In 
other words, truth is a defense to an action for def- 
amation. A person -has no right to a false character, 
and to speak the truth about him does not, therefore, 
constitute a tort. 

FRAUD OR DECEIT.â€” In order to establish 
the tort of fraud, it is necessary to prove the following 
five allegations: (1) that A makes a false statement of 
a material fact; (2) with knowledge of its falsity; (3) 
with the intent that it should be acted upon ; (4) that 
the other party believed it to be true; and, (5) acted 
upon it to his damage. The absence of any one of 
these five elements will prevent the action of fraud 
from existing. The action of fraud is most important 
not only in torts, but also it plays a large part in the 
law of contracts, and the law of sales, as to both real 
property and personal property. A stock broker says 
to Mr. Jones: "My house is offering the best bargain 
in oil stocks which has been on the market for five 
years. Aetna Oil Mining Stock at $5 a share is the 
best buy on the curb to-day. There is no doubt the 
company will pay 10% in dividends in the first year." 
Green, relying on this representation, purchases 100 
shares of the stock. The stock, thereafter, steadily 
declines, and never pays a dividend. Has he cause of 
action for fraud? Clearly not, because there has been 
no false statement of material fact. These statements 



COMMERCIAL LAW 413 

about the future earning capacity are seller's talk, or 
the salesman is merely puffing his wares. Both these 
expressions are common in the reports and for a mere 
statement of opinion, no action of fraud lies. It must 
be a statement of fact. Supposing the same broker 
had said to his customer, "Aetna Oil Company has 
paid 10% dividends for the last ten years," and such 
statement afterwards was found by the purchaser to 
have been false. An action of fraud would lie, because 
the dividend record of a company is in the past, and it 
is not opinion, but fact. Again, suppose the state- 
ments to have been the same as in the second illustra- 
tion, and that they were altogether false, but within 
three months, through a sudden change in conditions, 
the affairs of the company were greatly improved, the 
stock went up in value, and began to pay large divi- 
dends. Again, there would be no cause of action, be- 
cause the fifth element, that of damage, would be lack- 
ing. Again, suppose the purchaser, after learning 
from the broker about the past dividend record, should 
say, "I will give you my answer to-morrow." Mean- 
while, he looks up in a financial paper the dividend 
record and discovers the statements to be false. He 
then purchases the stock. Here he would have no 
cause of action, although he might be damaged, for 
the reason that by making his own investigation, he 
has clearly shown that he has not relied on the state- 
ment made by the broker, and the fourth element of 
the action of fraud is missing. In all of these situa- 
tions, the court assumes that it is dealing with a per- 
son of ordinary intelligence, and it does not require 



414 COMMERCIAL LAW 

the very highest degree of caution on the part of the 
person claiming to be defrauded, nor will it aid the de- 
frauded person if he does not exercise an ordinary de- 
gree of care in safeguarding his rights and forming his 
judgment in the particular transaction. In laying 
down this rule, the court does not require that a person 
must make his own private investigation ordinarily, 
but he may rely upon the statement made to him. For 
example, in a Massachusetts case, a real estate broker, 
in selling a piece of property to a purchaser in a subur- 
ban town adjoining Boston, told him that forty trains 
per day stopped there. The statement was false, the 
purchaser could have easily inquired at the railroad 
ticket office, which was only a short distance from the 
real estate agent's office, but he did not do so. It was 
held that he could recover in an action of fraud. Were 
it not so, the courts would, in practice, be laying down 
the rule that one must assume everyone a liar. On the 
other hand, had this same purchaser been defrauded 
by the same real estate dealer a half-dozen times be- 
fore, then he would not be acting as a reasonably care- 
ful man in relying on a statement of this kind. Under 
these circumstances, the ordinary prudent man would 
make his own investigation. 

FALSE IMPRISONMENT.â€” A person un- 
der ordinary conditions, enjoys the full right of free- 
dom of locomotion. The invasion of that right we call 
false imprisonment. It is immaterial how trivial the 
imprisonment may be, for merely locking a person in 
a room for five minutes as a joke would be enough to 
give rise to cause for action. The amount of damages 



COMMERCIAL LAW 415 

which the jury might allow under the circumstances 
would, of course, be another matter. Many of the 
principles mentioned in assault and battery are ap- 
plicable in this tort. Certain persons have a right to 
imprison other people, and it is not false imprison- 
ment. The sheriff of the county, with a warrant for 
my arrest, may imprison me, and, of course, I have no 
action for false imprisonment. He is acting under 
regular process from the court. A man commits a se- 
rious crime in my presence. I lock him in a room 
until I can call an officer. This is not false imprison- 
ment. The right of a private citizen to make an arrest 
and not be liable for false imprisonment is stated as 
follows in Section 183, of the New York Code of Crim- 
inal Procedure : 

A private person may arrest another: (1) For a 
crime, committed or attempted in his presence; (2) 
When the person arrested has committed a felony, 
although not in his presence. 

This is typical of the rule as it exists, with slight 
modifications, in most of the States. While mere 
words alone will not constitute an assault, it has been 
held that mere words will constitute false imprison- 
ment. While a person may be justified in arresting 
someone else, yet, for the abuse of that privilege, the 
same as using greater force in self-defense than is nec- 
essary, the action of false imprisonment will lie. The 
man whom I arrest for committing a very serious 
crime in my presence, I lock in my house and keep 
there a month, feeding him on bread and water. I am 
guilty of false imprisonment because while I had a 



416 COMMERCIAL LAW 

right to arrest him, it was my duty to turn him over 
to the proper authorities just as soon as possible. In 
a case, such as this, a month is, of course, an unrea- 
sonable time. 

NEGLIGENCE.â€” To say that negligence is fail- 
ure to use due care is a poor attempt at definition, but 
it is practically all that can be said. The common law- 
maxim, "sic utere tuo ut alium non laedas" (so use 
your own as not to injure another), is at this basis 
of the law of negligence. At the outset, we must be 
careful to distinguish between "accident" and "negli- 
gence." I am walking on a street and slip on a banana 
skin, and in falling, knock down a passing pedestrian. 
This is an accident. With my office window overlook- 
ing the street, in a banana-eating contest, I eat fifteen 
bananas, and throw the skins out of the window on 
the sidewalk. The street is not well lighted. A 
passerby falls and is injured. This is negligence, and 
I would be liable. 

CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE. â€” Negli- 
gence must be proved in order to entitle the injured 
party to recover. The court will not presume negli- 
gence merely because an injury takes place. Again, 
I repeatedly warn a motorman and conductor on a 
trolley car that I wish to get off at a certain station. 
Both parties forget the request, and the car goes by 
the station at the rate of fifteen miles an hour. I 
think I can get off safely, and attempt to do so. In 
doing so, I slip and break a leg. Although the two 
employees of the trolley company were negligent, for 
not attending to their business, I am guilty of con- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 417 

tributory negligence in trying to get off a rapidly 
moving car, and cannot recover. Contributory negli- 
gence is a bar to recovery. 

STANDARD OF CARE.â€” The standards of care 
to be applied in negligence vary from time to time. 
What vi^ould have been due care on the part of a rail- 
road company fifty years ago, would probably, in few 
cases, be held to be due care to-day. This is so, be- 
cause of the improvements which have been made in 
mechanical devices in the past fifty years. Again, in 
order to make a cause of action for negligence, there 
must be some causal relation between the negligent 
act and the injury. Granting that the man who 
slipped on the banana skin, which I threw from my 
office window, had sued me for damages because of 
his broken leg, it would not follow that I would be 
liable to the same man five years later, for the reason 
that an insurance company denied him a policy be- 
cause of stiffness in the same broken leg, caused by 
the fall on the banana skin. The law looks not at the 
remote, but at the proximate, cause of the injury. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” The owner of lands owes a 
duty to persons coming upon that land, and the fail- 
ure to perform that duty is negligence. Here, again, 
we have to consider who the person is. I enter Wan- 
amaker*s store to make a purchase. In going from 
the second to the third floor, I trip on a defective 
nosing on the stairway. This has been out of order 
for some time, and the floor walker was aware of 
that fact. I have a cause of action against Wana- 
maker's store for failure, on their part, to exercise 



418 COMMERCIAL LAW 

due care in having the premises reasonably safe for 
the use of customers. Suppose, in making a purchase 
in that same store, in the basement, I see an open door 
leading into the engine room where the heat genera- 
tor is located. Being interested in heating appliances, 
I go into the room, although there is a sign above the 
door "no admittance." I fall in an unguarded hole 
in the floor, which has been open for a long while, and 
the existence of this hole is known to the manage- 
ment. I cannot recover because I am a trespasser. I 
am in a place where I had no right to be, and, as to 
trespassers, the owner of property owes no duty, ex- 
cept to refrain from wilful attempts to injure such a 
person. I may not set a trap in my back yard to catch 
a trespasser, although I owe no duty to him to have 
the back yard safe for his use. A peculiar variation 
in this rule has been made by some States, in the so- 
called turn-tables cases. Railroads maintain turn- 
tables in their yards for the purpose of reversing loco- 
motives and other cars. While children, coming upon 
the premises, are trespassers, nevertheless, manj' 
courts have held that such things are what might be 
called "attractive nuisances," and in such cases the 
owner of property is under special duty to use care 
even as to trespassers, to see that they are not in- 
jured. These are merely a few of the general prin- 
ciples of the law of negligence as applied by the 
courts. 

CAPACITY OF PARTIES IN TORT AC- 
TIONS. â€” We discussed the question of the capacity 
of parties in making a contract. There is not as much 



COMMERCIAL LAW 419 

qualification upon a party's liability for tort as for 
contract. To-day, generally, a married woman is liable 
for her torts, the same as any one else. A corporation is 
liable for its torts committed by its agents or servants 
in the scope of their employment. An infant is held 
responsible for his torts. It is sometimes said that a 
person is liable for his torts from the cradle to the 
grave. This is not strictly true. If a baby two years 
old puts his finger in my eye, injuring it, he would 
clearly not be liable. But a person of tender years is 
liable for his torts, whenever he has sufficient intelli- 
gence to know what he is doing. Some courts place 
the age at seven years, while others consider each in- 
dividual case and the degree of intelligence possessed 
by the infant. 

THE CRIMINAL LAW.â€” A crime is a wrong 
which the State recognizes as injurious to the public 
welfare, and punishes in a criminal action in its own 
name. There are certain leading principles of the 
American system of criminal law which must be kept 
in mind. 

(1) A man is presumed to be innocent until the 
contrary is shown, and a jury, to be justified in bring- 
ing in a verdict of guilty, must be satisfied beyond a 
reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the accused. The rule 
in civil cases is that the jury must find for the plaintiif 
or defendant by a preponderance of evidence. Thus, 
it is possible for a person to secure a verdict in a civil 
action for damages for assault and batter]'', v^hile with 
the same evidence, a jury would not be justified, in a 
criminal action in convicting the defendant. 



420 COMMERCIAL LAW 

(2) In general, no person may be tried for a 
criminal offense, of any magnitude, until he has been 
indicted by a grand jury. The grand jury is generally 
twenty-four men, and hears the case against the pris- 
oner only as presented by the prosecutor or district 
attorney. If the grand jury believes the evidence to 
be sufficient to warrant a trial before the petit jury, 
they bring in a true bill, and then the trial takes place 
before the petit jury of twelve men, in open court. 
The prisoner is entitled to counsel, at the State's ex- 
pense, if he is not able to furnish his own. 

(3) The prisoner may not twice be put in 
jeopardy for the same offense. 

(4) A person may not be tried under an "ex 
post facto" law. 

An "ex post facto" law is one which makes an 
act, which was innocent when committed, a crime. 
Such laws are unconstitutional. This term is never 
used in civil law, but the term "retroactive statute" 
expresses the same idea. Thus, a statute passed Jan- 
uary 15, 1920, providing that all contracts made since 
January 1, 1919, must be witnessed by three witnesses, 
would be a "retroactive statute" and not valid. 

CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY.â€” As a gen- 
eral rule, if a person, when a crime is committed, has 
sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature of 
the particular act constituting the crime, and the 
mental capacity to know whether it is right or wrong, 
he is liable criminally, whatever may be his capacity 
in other respects. As in contracts, or torts, there is 
a special rule in regard to infants. The English com- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 421 

mon law, which is pretty generally followed in this 
country, is that a child under the age of seven is con- 
clusively presumed incapable of committing a crime. 
This is because of the fact that at common law, a 
criminal intent was necessary in all crimes, and an 
infant under seven was presumed not sufficiently ad- 
vanced to be able to form a criminal intent. Between 
the ages of seven and fourteen, there is a presumption 
of incapacity to commit a crime, the presumption be- 
ing very strong near seven, and rather weak near 
fourteen. Between the ages of fourteen and twenty- 
one, the presumption is that the infant is capable of 
committing a crime. As a general rule, one person 
is not liable for the crimes of another, unless he par- 
ticipated in them, directly or indirectly. A partner, 
therefore, is not liable, criminally, for the acts of his 
partners, merely because they are his partners. 
Neither is a principal or master liable for the criminal 
acts of his agent or servant, merely because the rela- 
tionship is that of principal and agent or master and 
servant. We will consider briefly a few of the more 
important crimes. 

HOMICIDE.â€” Homicide is the killing of a hu- 
man being, and is divided into excusable, felonious, 
and justifiable homicide. The distinction between 
excusable and justifiable homicide is very slight and 
perhaps of little utility. Where either exists, a homi- 
cide takes place under such circumstances that the 
party cannot strictly be said to have committed the 
act wilfully and intentionally, or if he does commit it 
with full intention, under such circumstances of duty 



422 COMMERCIAL LAV/ 

as to render the act performed not a felonious homi- 
cide. A felonious homicide is committed wilfully and 
under such circumstances as to render it punishable. 
Murder is the wilful killing of any person with malice 
aforethought. In some States, by legislative enact- 
ments, murder is divided into degrees, as murder in 
the first degree and murder in the second degree. The 
penalty for murder in the first degree is death, or in a 
State where capital punishment is abolished, life im- 
prisonment. There are various other distinctions be- 
tween these two form.s of murder which must be as- 
certained from the statutes themselves. 

MANSLAUGHTER.â€” Manslaughter is the un- 
lawful killing of another without malice, either ex- 
press or implied. Manslaughter is also frequently 
divided into different degrees, and the punishment 
varies accordingly. A reference to the State statutes 
is necessary, as in murder, to know what the local 
law is. 

BURGLARY. â€” Burglary, as a common law of- 
fense, is the breaking and entering of a dwelling house 
of another, in the night time, with the intent to com- 
mit a felony therein, whether the felony be actually 
committed or not. But in most jurisdictions the of- 
fense has been extended by statute so as to include 
breaking and entries which were not burglary at com- 
mon law. Unless changed by statute, it must be 
committed in the night time, and there must be both 
a breaking and an entering. Breaking a window, 
taking a pane of glass out, or bending the nails, is a 
breaking. Cutting a wire netting on a screen door is 



COMMERCIAL LAW 423 

also a breaking. In such cases a screen door is not 
to be considered as a mere protection against flies 
and mosquitoes, but as a part of the building. As to 
whether opening a door or a window, already partly 
open, constitutes a breaking, the cases are in conflict. 
Without the intent to commit a felony, breaking and 
entering is a bare trespass, which would not be a 
crime. The felonious intent must exist at the time 
of the breaking and entering. Hence, if it can be 
proved satisfactorily to a jury, that a man broke into 
a house for a night's lodging only, he would not be 
guilty of burglary. As in homicide, reference must 
be made to the local statutes for the actual definition 
of burglary and its punishment in that jurisdiction. 

FORGERY. â€” Forgery is the false making of an 
alteration of a writing to the prejudice of another 
man's right. Forgery may be committed of any writ- 
ing, which, if changed, would operate as the founda- 
tion of another man's liability. Hence a check may 
be forged, an assignment of a legal claim, an indorse- 
ment on any negotiable document, an acceptance of 
a bill of exchange, a letter of recommendation, a rail- 
road pass or railroad ticket. The penalty for forgery 
and various other acts of which it may consist, are so 
purely statutory as to make any further comment 
useless. 

LARCENY. â€” Larceny is the felonious taking of 
the property of another, without his consent and 
against his will, with the intent to convert it to the 
use of the taker. The taking must be with criminal 
intent, but not necessarily for the sake of gain, al- 



424 COMMERCIAL LAW 

though the property must be of some value, however 
slight. The taking must be against the consent of 
the owner, and if the consent is given, although ob- 
tained by fraud, the crime is not larceny. Larceny 
relates only to personal property. Hence the state- 
ment made falsely concerning A: "you are a thief. 
You stole my marie" (marie being a kind of earth), 
is not slander, because it is not a charge of a crime 
involving moral turpitude, as real property is not the 
subject of larceny. Larceny is generally divided into 
petty larceny and grand larceny, the difference be- 
tween the two being generally the amount involved, 
which varies with the local legislation. 

ROBBERY. â€” Robbery, at common law, is the 
taking, with intent to steal, of personal property in 
possession of another, from his person or in his pres- 
ence, by violence or by putting him in fear. In a 
majority of jurisdictions, statutes have been enacted 
defining robbery substantially in accord with the com- 
mon law. It is not necessary that the property taken 
should be the property of the person from whom it 
is taken. As in other crimes, there must be a criminal 
intent, and so where, in an indictment, the offense 
was charged as robbery, but as proved was, at most, 
an improper and rude act, and intended only as a joke, 
it was held that no robbery had been committed. 



CHAPTER XIV 



Miscellaneous 

INSOLVENT DEBTORS â€” "GRAB LAW." â€” 
When a debtor is insolvent there are several 

things that he may do. In the first place he may 
do nothing. He may let his creditors try to get any 
money out of him if they can, and in general let the 
creditors take the laboring oar. Where there is no 
bankruptcy lav^ prevailing, either State or Federal â€” 
and that was the situation in many of the States of 
the Union prior to the passage of the present Na- 
tional bankruptcy lav^^ â€” a debtor might get along 
that way for a long time. That is one thing he 
might do. 

COMPOSITION WITH CREDITORS.â€” The 
second thing the debtor may conceivably do is to try 
to make a composition with his creditors. Though 
it is the law that receiving a smaller sum will not dis- 
charge a liquidated and undisputed debt for a larger 
amount, even if it is so agreed, an exception is made 
in the case of a composition where a number of credi- 
tors agree that each of them will take a smaller sum 
for his claim. The debtor may try to get his creditors 
to do that, and occasionally he succeeds. 

GENERAL ASSIGNMENTS.â€” A third thing 
which he may do is to make a general assignment of 
all his property to trustees in trust to pay his credit 
tors ratably. Such an assignment is not valid in 
Massachusetts, though in most States it would be, if 

425 



426 COMMERCIAL LAW 

free from fraudulent incidents. In Massachusetts it 
would not prevent his creditors, or any one of them, 
from attaching his property just as if it had not been 
assigned, but if creditors assent to the assignment 
then, to the extent of their claims, the assignment 
becomes valid. In other States the assent of credi- 
tors is presumed if the assignment is not fraudulent, 
and therefore without any actual assent the situation 
is the same as in Massachusetts after assent of all 
the creditors. 

FRAUDULENT INCIDENTS IN GENERAL 
ASSIGNMENTS.â€” In every State a general assign- 
ment under certain circumstances will be regarded as 
fraudulent against creditors. Such a conveyance may 
be treated as void by the creditors, and the property 
conveyed seized by them as if the debtor had made 
no conveyance. Some of these incidents which may 
make a general assignment fraudulent may be noted. 
If the assignor was solvent when the conveyance was 
made, the transaction is fraudulent, for if he has suffi- 
cient assets to pay his debts, the only object the as- 
signment can have is to prevent them from being 
paid at once, and compel the creditors to wait until 
the assignees under the deed realize upon the prop- 
erty, that the debtor holds, at better advantage than 
if a forced sale were made at once. If the assignees 
are given unlimited power to continue business it is 
also fraudulent, since the business would in effect be 
carried on at the risk of the debtor. The debtor be- 
ing insolvent will lose nothing if the business proves 
unprofitable whereas if profitable there may be a sur- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 427 

plus after the payment of the debts. A provision 
authorizing continuance of business so far as is nec- 
essary to dispose of property on hand, or to work 
up raw material on hand, is generally upheld. A pro- 
vision authorizing sales upon credit is often, though 
not uniformly, held fraudulent, since it permits the 
assignees to defer the settlement of the estate. The 
most important provisions likely to be attacked as 
fraudulent, however, are provisions in regard to pref- 
erences. Aside from bankruptcy statutes, it is lawful 
for a debtor who has insufficient means to pay all of 
his creditors, to pay some in full, though this results 
in the total exclusion of others. Accordingly a gen- 
eral assignment of a debtor's property on a trust, that 
the assignees shall pay in full certain named creditors 
and pay the remaining creditors ratably out of the 
residue, has generally been upheld though statutes in 
some States have altered the law in this respect. A 
kind of preference which is generally deemed fraudu- 
lent, however, is one which is made conditional on 
the creditors giving the debtor a discharge. A gen- 
eral assignment, unlike a bankruptcy law, or a com- 
position, does not free the debtor from liability for 
so much of his debt as remains unpaid. Debtors have 
sometimes sought to avoid this result by making a 
general assignment of their property in trust for 
ratable distribution among such creditors as should 
give the debtor a full release and discharge of all 
claims. Such a provision, attempting, as it does, to 
impose as a condition of a creditor's sharing, that he 
should take his share in full satisfaction of his claim, 



428 COMMERCIAL LAW 

is almost universally held to make a general assign- 
ment fraudulent. Under the bankruptcy law, a gen- 
eral assignment may within four months be set aside 
by bankruptcy proceedings; but a creditor who has 
once assented to a general assignment cannot there- 
after join in a bankruptcy petition against that debtor. 
BANKRUPTCY.â€” The fourth and most impor- 
tant way, however, now, of settling the estates of in- 
solvent persons is provided by statute. The Federal 
Constitution gives Congress power to pass uniform 
laws on the subject of bankruptcy throughout the 
United States, and the Supreme Court has held that 
when the Federal Government has not taken advan- 
tage of this privilege given by the Constitution, States 
have power themselves to enact bankruptcy laws. In 
some States there were such laws, but in many there 
were not. The Federal law now supersedes all State 
laws on the subject. It was passed in 1898, and under 
that law the debtor may either become a bankrupt by 
his own voluntary petition, or his creditors may peti- 
tion him into bankruptcy if he commits what is called 
an "act of bankruptcy." This is true, at least, if the 
debtor is an individual, or is a moneyed business or 
commercial corporation (except railroads, insurance 
companies, and banking corporations). When cor- 
porations of the excepted class become insolvent, their 
affairs are settled by still a fifth method â€” receivership. 
A special privilege, also, is given to wage earners and 
farmers. They may, if they choose, become volun- 
tary bankrupts, but are not liable to involuntary pro- 
ceedings. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 429 

PETITIONS IN BANKRUPTCY.â€” Suppose a 
debtor wishes to become bankrupt himself. He files 
a petition in the United States District Court, which 
is the court of bankruptcy jurisdiction, and is imme- 
diately adjudicated a bankrupt. If his creditors want 
to make him a bankrupt it is necessary that three of 
them, having claims amounting to not less than $500 
in the aggregate, should join, unless there are less 
than twelve creditors in all. In that event one credi- 
tor only may petition. This petition must set forth 
(1) the creditors' claims, (2) the fact that the debtor 
has committed an act of bankruptcy, and (3) the fact 
that he owes debts aggregating $1,000 or more. How- 
ever slight his indebtedness, if he cannot pay it, a man 
may be a voluntary bankrupt, but he must owe at 
least $1,000 to be liable to involuntary proceedings. 

ACTS OF BANKRUPTCYâ€” FRAUDULENT 
CONVEYANCES.â€” Now what are the acts of bank- 
ruptcy which render a debtor liable to a petition by 
his creditors? In the first place a fraudulent convey- 
ance is an act of bankruptcy. Reference to a fraudu- 
lent conveyance by general assignment has been 
made; but there are many kinds of fraudulent con- 
veyances. If a debtor who is insolvent, or who is 
made insolvent through a gift made by himself, should 
give away a portion of his property, that would be a 
fraudulent conveyance, irrespective of the debtor's 
intent, because the necessary effect of the gift would 
be to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors. It would 
be a fraudulent conveyance for a debtor to seek to 
conceal his property from his creditors by putting it 



430 COMMERCIAL LAW 

in the hands of some kind friend to hold for him until 
his creditors should cease to be so troublesome as at 
the present time. It would be a fraudulent convey- 
ance for a man who is pressed by creditors to turn 
himself into a corporation for business purposes, and 
assign all his property to that corporation. This 
transfer to a corporation, even though done openly, 
would necessarily hinder and delay his creditors. 

PREFERENCES.â€” As has already been said, 
paying one creditor to the exclusion of others is not 
a fraudulent conveyance, but it is a preference, and a 
preference is a second act of bankruptcy. Either for 
the debtor to give a preference himself or to allow a 
creditor to get a preference, by legal proceedings, is 
an act of bankruptcy. Any transfer made by an in- 
solvent debtor, to pay or to secure in whole or in part 
a previously existing debt, is a preference. 

GENERAL ASSIGNMENTS.â€” A general as- 
signment, whether fraudulent or not, is an act of 
bankruptcy. The consequence is, therefore, that if a 
debtor makes a general assignment, his creditors have 
the choice of letting it stand and having the estate 
settled under the general assignment, or of setting it 
aside and having bankruptcy proceedings. 

RECEIVERSHIPS.â€” Still another act of bank- 
ruptcy is the appointment of a receiver on account 
of insolvency. There, also, the creditors virtually 
have an option of letting the receivership stand and 
having the receiver take charge of the distribution 
of the assets, or of petitioning the debtor into bank- 
ruptcy and having the bankruptcy court take charge. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 431 

ADMISSION OF INABILITY TO PAY 
DEBTS. â€” One further act of bankruptcy is an ad~ 
mission by the debtor of his inability to pay his debts 
and his willingness to be adjudicated a bankrupt. An 
act of bankruptcy can form the basis of a petition 
only within four months after its commission. 

INSOLVENT DEBTORS USUALLY COM- 
MIT ACTS OF BANKRUPTCY.â€” Now an insolv- 
ent debtor cannot very well avoid committing one of 
these acts of bankruptcy. He can avoid making a 
fraudulent conveyance, but he will find it pretty hard 
to avoid making a preference. He need not, it is true, 
pay any of his debts, and it is not a preference to pay 
money out for present consideration, or to transfer 
property for present consideration, as to make a mort- 
gage for a new loan; but it will be hard for him to 
prevent creditors from getting a preference by legal 
proceedings, at least if the debtor has any assets at 
all ; for if the debtor does not pay any of his creditors, 
some of his creditors will sue him, get execution, and 
endeavor to levy it on the debtor's property. 

PROCEDURE AFTER ADJUDICATION.â€” 
If a debtor has once been adjudicated a bankrupt, it 
makes no difference whether it was on a voluntary 
petition or an involuntary petition; the matter goes 
on in both cases the same way. The first thing, after 
the adjudication, is, that the referee, a sort of sub- 
ordinate judge, requires the bankrupt to submit sched- 
ules of his assets and of his creditors. The debtor is 
induced to make these schedules as complete as pos- 
sible, for the following reasons: if the schedule of 



432 COMMERCIAL LAW 

assets is knowingly incomplete, the debtor is com- 
mitting a crime and is likely to be shut up in jail. If 
the schedule of his creditors is incomplete, any credi- 
tor who is left out or whose address is so incorrectly 
given that the creditor does not get notice of the pro- 
ceedings in time to prove his claim, is not affected 
by the discharge ; and as the debtor wants a discharge 
from as many debts as possible, he, of course, will 
make his schedule of creditors as complete as possi- 
ble. From this schedule of creditors, the referee sends 
notices out to all the creditors to meet and choose the 
trustee. The creditors meet and choose a trustee, 
who then endeavors to collect the assets of the estate, 
and under the direction of the court, pays dividends 
from the assets to the creditors. 

PROPERTY WHICH THE TRUSTEE GETS. 
â€” The question may be asked : "What property does 
the trustee get?" He gets all tangible property that 
the debtor could transfer at the moment of his bank- 
ruptcy. He gets intangible property, patents, trade- 
marks, copyrights, seats on the stock exchange, and 
good-will of a business, with the exception that the 
debtor still retains the right to carry on his old busi- 
ness himself, in the future, in his own name. The 
trustee gets rights of action of the bankrupt, except 
personal rights of action, as they are called. These 
consist of rights of action for personal injuries, as 
for assault, or for personal injury by negligence. A 
right of action for breach of promise of marriage also 
would not pass to the trustee in bankruptcy. Not 
only does a trustee get this tangible and intangible 



COMMERCIAL LAW 433 

property, but he gets also a right to recover any prop- 
erty fraudulently conveyed by the bankrupt, which 
is not in the hands of a bona fide purchaser, even if 
the fraudulent conveyance was made years before, 
provided the statute of limitations has not completely 
run against it. Any preference, also made within 
four months before the filing of the petition in bank- 
ruptcy, may be recovered from the preferred creditor, 
if he had reasonable cause to believe, when he re- 
ceived it, that he was getting a preference, but 
not otherwise. The trustee in bankruptcy gets the 
debtor's life insurance policies, except in so far as 
they are made exempt by statute. Life-insurance 
policies, in favor of a beneficiary other than the in- 
sured himself, are exempt, though if the premiums 
were paid by the debtor while insolvent, the pre- 
miums so paid within the past six years may be re- 
covered, and the beneficiary would in effect have to 
pay those premiums back in order to hold the policy. 
Even if the policy runs to the insured himself, in his 
own name, he has the privilege, under the bankruptcy 
act, to redeem it from the trustee in bankruptcy by 
paying its cash surrender value. Property acquired 
by the bankrupt, after the beginning of bankruptcy 
proceedings, does not pass to the trustee. The bank- 
rupt's property passes free of attachment or judg- 
ment liens, secured by creditors within four months 
prior to the beginning of bankruptcy proceedings. 
This has no bearing on a case, where, prior to bank- 
ruptcy, money has been actually collected by legal 
proceedings, but only to cases of seizure under legal 



434 COMMERCIAL LAW 

proceedings which are still pending at the time the 
petition is filed. If a debtor becomes bankrupt, within 
four months after his property is attached, the at- 
tachment is dissolved. If the debtor does not become 
bankrupt until after four months, the attachment is 
a valid lien on the property attached, and so far as 
the property is sufficient to pay the creditor, he can 
collect his claim from it, even though the debtor be- 
comes bankrupt before the creditor finally gets judg- 
ment and collects his claim. 

PROOF OF CLAIMS.â€” The trustee collects all 
this property and tries to reduce it to cash, as fast as 
he can, and while this is going on, creditors will also 
be proving their claims. It is only claims which exist 
at the time of filing the petition which are provable, 
but the debts need not be due at the time of the bank- 
ruptcy; it is only essential that they shall be in ex- 
istence. Interest is added or rebated, as the case 
may be, to the date of filing the petition. That is, if 
you have a non-interest-bearing note falling due July 
1, and the debtor becomes bankrupt May 1, the face 
of the note will be proved less a rebate of two months' 
interest to May 1, because the present value of the 
note on May 1 is what is provable. On the other 
hand, if the note had been due on April 1, interest 
would be added up to the date of filing the petition, 
and if the note was an interest-bearing note, of course 
the interest would be provable up to May 1, even if 
the note did not fall due until July 1 or later. Debts, 
arising subsequently to the date of filing the petition, 
must be enforced against the bankrupt's assets ac- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 435 

quired after his bankruptcy. Claims for tort are not 
provable, that is, claims for injuries to person or prop- 
erty not arising out of contact. But a judgment for 
tort, obtained before the filing of the petition, is prov- 
able. There has been a good deal of trouble in regard 
to what are called contingent claims. The common- 
est instance is the indorser's liability on a note which 
is not yet due when the indorser becomes bankrupt. 
At the time of filing the petition, the indorser's liabil- 
ity is contingent on the possibility that the maker may 
not pay the note at maturity, and that notice of dis- 
honor will be given to the indorser. Creditors, who 
have received a preference, cannot prove claims unless 
they have surrendered, within four months of the 
bankruptcy, any preference which they have received 
with reasonable cause to believe that it was a prefer- 
ence. Secured creditors can realize on their security 
and then prove for the balance of their claims. A 
few claims are given priority over others and paid in 
full before any dividend to other creditors. The most 
important claims of this sort are the wages of work- 
men, clerks or servants earned within three months 
of the bankruptcy and not exceeding the sum of 
$300. 

LEASES. â€” Leases belonging to the bankrupt 
pass to the trustee in bankruptcy, if he wants them, 
but the trustee in bankruptcy need not take any kind 
of property which seems more burdensome than ben- 
eficial to him, and as a trustee would have to pay, the 
rent under a lease in full, if he took it, he frequently 
will prefer to abandon it. The landlord can prove for 



436 COMMERCIAL LAW 

rent, which is already accrued, but he cannot prove 
for rent which has not already accrued, even though 
part of the period for which the rent is claimed has 
elapsed, unless there is a special covenant in the lease. 
If the trustee in bankruptcy assumed the lease, then, 
of course, the landlord would look to the trustee for 
the rest of the term. If the trustee did not assume 
the lease, the landlord would have his option of doing 
either of two things: he could leave the bankrupt in 
the premises and have a right of action against him 
for the rent, from time to time, as it accrued, or he 
could eject the tenant; but if he ejected the tenant 
he could not hold him for rent. Generally he would 
eject a bankrupt tenant rather than let him stay. 

SET-OFF.â€” Set-off may be made by a debtor of 
the estate who also has a claim against the estate. He 
does not have to prove his claim, taking a dividend 
on it and then paying, in full, the debt which he owes 
to the estate. He may set one off against the other, 
but he is not allowed to acquire claims for the pur- 
pose of set-off within four months prior to bank- 
ruptcy. Otherwise, one owing money to an insolvent 
debtor, could buy up at a discount claims against the 
debtor, equal in amount to his indebtedness to the 
bankrupt. 

EXAMINATION AND DISCHARGE OF 
BANKRUPT. â€” The bankrupt may be examined by 
any creditor with a view to the disclosure of his as- 
sets. This is a most important right. Finally, if 
in every respect, he obeys the bankruptcy law, the 
debtor gets a discharge. Grounds for refusing him 



COMMERCIAL LAV/ 437 

a discharge are, that he has made a fraudulent con- 
veyance; that he has obtained credit by false repre- 
sentation ; thatthe has failed to keep books of account 
for the purpose of concealing his financial condition ; 
that he has committed an offence punishable by the 
bankruptcy law, as making a false oath or refusal to 
disclose his property or to submit to examination; 
and finally a debtor who has already been discharged 
in bankruptcy within the previous six years cannot, 
as a voluntary bankrupt, again obtain a discharge. 
These are reasons for refusing a discharge altogether, 
but even though a discharge is granted, certain 'liabili- 
ties are not discharged. Claims for obtaining prop- 
erty by false pretences, or for false representations, 
are not discharged. Claims for defalcation or em- 
bezzlement, as a public officer or as a fiduciary, and 
claims for wilful and malicious injury to the property 
of another, are not discharged. Nor are taxes or 
claims for alimony or for the support of a wife or de- 
pendent children. 

COMPOSITION IN BANKRUPTCY. â€” At 
common law it was necessary to have the consent of 
all a debtor's creditors in order to make the composi- 
tion operative as against all of them. In bankruptcy 
there is a special provision for composition, and with 
the approval of the court, a composition may be de- 
clared binding, not only as against those who have 
assented to it, but as against all creditors having 
provable claims, if a majority in number and amount 
of the creditors, taking part in the bankruptcy pro- 
ceedings, assent to the discharge. 



438 COMMERCIAL LAW 

INSURANCE. â€” Insurance is a contract where- 
by, for an agreed premium, one party undertakes to 
compensate the other for loss on a specified subject 
from specified perils. Policies of insurance are as 
various as the contracts which they cover. In 1779, 
Lloyd's adopted a standard form of marine policy, 
which, with some changes, is in practically universal 
use in the British world. A standard form of fire 
policy has been adopted by many of the fire insurance 
companies in the United States. 

POLICY PROVISIONS.â€” Certain terms occur 
frequently in insurance law, with which one should 
be familiar. A valued policy is one upon which a 
definite valuation is put, by agreement of both parties, 
on the subject matter of the insurance written on the 
policy; for example, a policy "insuring the S.S. George 
Washington, valued at $1,000,000." An open policy, 
on the other hand, is one in which a definite sum is 
written on the face of the policy, but instead of agree- 
ing as to the value of the property insured, indicates 
the limit of recovery in case of the destruction of the 
property. Floating policies are such as cover articles 
which cannot be designated with certainty, as for ex- 
ample, a constantly changing stock of goods. In life 
insurance there are many kinds of policies. Probably 
the most common is the regular life, under which the 
insured pays certain fixed premiums throughout life, 
and the beneficiary receives the amount of the policy 
only upon the death of the insured. Life insurance 
policies in which the investment feature is prominent, 
are generally called endowment policies, and they re- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 439 

quire the insured to pay a certain premium, annually, 
for a certain number of years. If the insured dies 
before premium payments cease, under the terms of 
the policy, the beneficiary receives the full amount 
of the policy. If the insured lives beyond the stated 
period, he is entitled to receive the amount written 
on the face of the policy or he may be allowed to re- 
ceive a paid-up policy for some specified sum. A 
policy of reinsurance is simply a contract made by 
one insurance company with another, whereby the 
first reinsures with the second some individual risk 
which it has itself accepted and insured. 

ELEMENTS OF CONTRACT.â€” In order that 
the contract of insurance shall be valid, it must pos- 
sess all the essential elements of the ordinary con- 
tract. Although there is a certain element of chance 
in an insurance contract, it is always held that it is 
not in the nature of a gambling contract. A peculiar 
feature of this contract is that it is one of the utmost 
good faith, and requires that each party shall disclose 
to the other all material facts in his knowledge that 
may affect the making of the contract. 

INSURABLE INTEREST.â€” An essential ele- 
ment in the law of insurance is that of insurable in- 
terest. By this term we mean that interest of the in- 
sured, which is exposed to injury by reason of the 
peril insured against. Such interest does not nec- 
essarily need to be a legal right, but only such as to 
justify a reasonable expectation of financial benefit, 
which will be derived by the continued existence of 
the person or property insured. While it is difficult to 



440 COMMERCIAL LAW 

define accurately an insurable interest in property, 
Section 2546 of the California Civil Code defines it 
thus: "Every interest in property, or any relation 
thereto, or liability in respect thereof, of such a nature 
that a contemplated peril might directly damnify the 
insurer, is an insurable interest." In life insurance, 
an insurable interest is requisite, but this interest, if 
existing at the time the policy is issued, is sufficient, 
although such interest subsequently terminates. Ev- 
ery person has an insurable interest in his own life, 
or he may procure insurance on the life of another, 
when so related to that other, either by reason of 
blood, marriage, or commerce, that he has well- 
grounded expectation of deriving benefit from that 
other's life, or suffering detriment through its termi- 
nation. It is well settled that a creditor has an insur- 
able interest in the life of his debtor. The courts 
are not clear as to just how much this interest is, but 
it will not be allov/ed to greatly exceed the sum of the 
debt. The relationship between the insured and the 
insurer is governed, to a very large extent, by the law 
of agency. 

SURETYSHIP AND GUARANTY.â€” Surety- 
ship has been defined as an accessory agreement by 
which one binds himself for another who is already 
bound. A surety is a person who is liable to perform 
any act, that his principal is bound to perform, in 
the event that his principal fails to perform as agreed. 
Where there is more than one surety, the parties are 
known as co-sureties. The distinction between the 
contract of suretyship and that of guaranty is not al- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 441 

together clear, and frequently not observed by the 
courts. So far as the distinction can be defined, we 
may say that if the parties undertake to pay money, 
or to do some other agreed act, in case the principal 
fails to perform his part, then they are sureties. On 
the other hand, if they assume performance, only in 
the event that the principal is unable to perform, then 
they are guarantors. The principles which apply to 
both, are, in many respects, similar. The terms used 
by the parties are not necessarily conclusive as to 
whether it is a suretyship or guaranty relationship. 
For example, in the case of Saint v. Wheeler, etc., 
Mfg. Co., 95 Ala. 362, where a contract was under 
seal by which the parties "guarantee," along with one 
of their number, to pay absolutely and irrespective of 
solvency or insolvency, all damages which might re- 
sult, etc., it was held that the contract was one of 
suretyship, and not of guaranty, although they had 
used the express term "guarantee" in the language of 
the contract. 

QUALIFICATION OF A SURETY.â€” A surety 
may be distinguished from an indorser in that the 
undertaking of the surety is absolute, whereas that of 
the indorser is conditional. The Negotiable Instru- 
ments Act provides that a general indorser "engages 
that on due presentment, it (the instrument) shall 
be accepted or paid, or both, as the case may be, ac- 
cording to its tenor, and that if it be dishonored, and 
the necessary proceedings on dishonor be duly taken, 
he will pay the amount thereof to the holder, or to 
any subsequent indorser who may be compelled to 



442 COMMERCIAL LAW 

pay it." Hence, if an indorser is not notified, or if 
the instrument is not protested, if that is necessary, 
he is discharged. 

PRINCIPAL AND SURETY.â€” Ordinarily, the 
relationship of principal and surety is entered into 
under the terms of a contract, the chief object of 
which is the creation of the relationship. As a general 
rule, any person who is capable of making a contract 
may be surety. Formerly, it was sometimes said that 
an infant was absolutely unqualified to make a con- 
tract of this kind, but now his contracts of surety- 
ship are held to be voidable, the same as his other 
contracts. In some states a married woman is still 
prevented by statute from becoming a surety for her 
husband. Like ordinary contracts, a contract of sure- 
tyship must be supported by sufficient consideration. 
It is ordinarily a collateral engagement to pay a debt 
of another, and hence, comes under the section of the 
Statute of Frauds which requires a contract to an- 
swer for the "debt, default, or miscarriage of another," 
to be in writing. 

SURETYSHIP LIABILITY.â€” The general ex- 
tent of the suretyship liability is measured by the 
contract of the principal, which he guarantees. If 
no cause of action can be maintained against the prin- 
cipal on the contract, it follows necessarily that the 
surety is not liable. The tendency of the courts is to 
favor the surety. His obligation is ordinarily assumed 
without any pecuniary compensation, and it is ac- 
cordingly said that his liability is "strictissimi juris/' 
(strictly construed by the law). A surety has the 



COMMERCIAL LAW 443 

right, then, to insist upon the very letter of his con- 
tract, and if there is a reasonable doubt as to whether 
his contract requires the doing of certain acts or not, 
that doubt should be resolved by the court in favor of 
the surety. Consequently, a surety will not ordi- 
narily be held liable for any default of the principal, 
which occurred prior to the surety's contract to be 
such. The death of the surety does not necessarily 
terminate his liability, and his personal representa- 
tives will be responsible for the carrying out of his 
contract, especially where the contract reads that the 
surety "binds his heirs, executors and administra- 
tors." 

SURETY'S OBLIGATION UNDER NEV/ 
CONTRACT.â€” It frequently happens that the prin- 
cipal's contract is not completed, and a renewal is 
necessary. The question arises whether the surety's 
obligations are continued under the new contract, the 
same as under the old. The principle which the courts 
apply is that if the renewal amounts to an entirely 
new contract, then the surety's obligation is at an end. 
But if the renewal is simply a part of the original 
contract, and does not call for any new contract, his 
obligation continues under such renewal. As the con- 
tract between the principal and surety is of a more 
or less confidential character, the law requires, as we 
have mentioned in insurance, the exercise of the ut- 
most good faith on the part of the principal. Hence, 
if a surety, before entering into his contract, applies 
to the principal for information about any material 
matter pertaining to the contract, the principal is 



444 COMMERCIAL LAW 

bound to give full information as to every fact within 
his knowledge, and if he does anything to deceive the 
surety, he vitiates the contract. Another application 
of the same principle is found in the rule that the 
principal must not do any act injurious to the surety 
or inconsistent with his rights. Consequently, if the 
principal makes any arrangement with his principal 
debtor, by which the risk of the surety is materially 
increased, or the terms of the contract are altered or 
varied or the time of payment is extended, the surety 
in any of these cases would be released from any lia- 
bility unless he is consulted and gives his assent to 
such changes in his contract. It is necessary that the 
new contract, which the principal makes, be a valid 
contract in order to release the surety. Hence, if the 
principal makes a contract extending the time of the 
payment on the obligation six months, and that is 
all there is to the contract, such extension agreement 
would be invalid because of lack of consideration, and 
the surety in such case would not be discharged from 
his liability under the old contract. If the obligation 
which the surety undertakes to pay is a promissory 
note, an agreement by the principal to extend the 
time of payment, would not, of itself, release the 
surety, there being no consideration. A part payment 
made by the maker, before the note was due, for 
which an extension of time to pay the remainder is 
granted, would be binding, because such part pay- 
ment, before a note is due, constitutes good consider- 
ation for an agreement to extend the time to pay the 
balance, and consequently the surety is discharged. 



COMMERCIAL LAW 445 

NEGLIGENCE OF THE CREDITOR.â€” It is 
generally true that the creditor is under no obligation 
to be diligent in the pursuit of the debtor. Conse- 
quently, a mere negligence of the creditor, to sue or 
otherwise attempt to collect a claim against his debt- 
or, although there is a surety for the creditor, does 
not relieve the surety of his liability. Mere delay, 
then, in proceeding against the principal debtor, does 
not release the surety, unless there is between the 
creditor and principal debtor a valid and binding 
agreement, under which a delay does prejudice the 
surety. 

DISCHARGE OF SURETY.â€” A surety is dis- 
charged by the payment or performance, by the prin- 
cipal, of the condition in the agreement. It is even 
held that the surety is discharged if a tender of pay- 
ment has been made to the principal, after the debt 
is due, and it is refused by him. In such a case, the 
tender amounts practically to a payment of the debt 
and a new loan creating a new contract. It sometimes 
occurs that the creditor has collateral security for the 
payment of the debt, or secures control of money or 
property of the debtor and which he may lawfully 
apply to the debtor's obligations under certain cir- 
cumstances. The principal may voluntarily surrender 
or dispose of these securities. In such a case, the 
surety is discharged from liability to the extent of 
the value of the securities disposed of or surrendered. 
Of course, the surety is not discharged where the 
principal takes additional securities, or if some secu- 
rities are given up and sufficient are retained by the 



446 COMMERCIAL LAW 

principal to pay the debt, the surety is not relieved 
and cannot complain, for the reason that he has not 
been injured. 

RIGHTS OF SURETY.â€” It is a well established 
rule of law that where the surety is obliged to make 
good on his contract he is entitled to relief, the law im- 
plying a promise on the part of the principal to reim- 
burse the surety for any damages which he suffers. 
Of course, this assumes that the surety was legally 
bound to pay the debt. If he pays it because it is a 
moral obligation or for any other reason which the 
law does not recognize as legally binding, he is not 
able to compel the principal to reimburse him. 

RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION.â€” One of the 
peculiar remedies, which the courts of equity have 
developed, is that of contribution. This right is fre- 
quently used in the law of suretyship. When one of 
two or more sureties, for the same obligation, has 
paid more than his share of the debt, he is entitled 
to be reimbursed for the excess by his co-sureties. 
This right is known as the right of contribution. As 
has been said before, a surety, if he pays when he 
is not legally bound to do so, must stand the loss him- 
self ; and the same is true where he is one of several 
co-sureties. Thus, if one co-surety pays a debt, which 
is barred by the statute of limitations, he would not, 
in that case, be entitled to contribution from his other 
co-sureties. 

SURETY COMPANIES.â€” Surety companies 
conduct such a large business at the present time that 
a word should be said about them in connection with 



COMMERCIAL LAW 447 

this topic. The surety company is a corporation, and 
its powers are, of course, defined by its charter, and 
the laws of the State in which it is incorporated. In 
general, surety companies are authorized to guarantee 
performance of contracts and to execute bonds and 
undertakings required by the courts. One tendency 
is noticeable in recent years. The kind of suretyship, 
we have been referring to, is generally that in which 
the surety is an individual, who undertakes his 
task for no consideration, and for that reason, as we 
have said, the courts construe the contract of surety- 
ship strictly in favor of the surety. More and more, 
now, the practice of the individual becoming a surety 
is decreasing, and in his place the surety companies 
offer their services in a more satisfactory manner, un- 
der modern business conditions, but with the striking 
difference, that the surety company offers its services 
only for pay, which will net the company a profit. 
Hence, the rule that the contract should be construed 
strictly in favor of the surety does not fit the case of 
the surety company which is paid for its services. In 
the case of the American Surety Co. v. Paulu, 170 U.S. 
133, and in many other cases, the rule is laid down, 
that the contract will be construed against the surety 
company and in favor of the indemnity which the 
obligee has reasonable grounds to expect. So, it has 
been held that a surety company will not be relieved 
on its contract, by an extension of time to the prin- 
cipal, and that there is no presumption that the surety 
was injured by the extension unless the injury is 
actually proved. 



448 COMMERCIAL LAW 

PATENTS. â€” The policy of encouraging mo- 
nopolies, while generally frowned upon, finds two ex- 
ceptions in the law of patents and copyrights. Con- 
sequently, the Federal Constitution gives the exclu- 
sive right to Congress to "promote the progress of 
science and useful arts by securing for limited times, 
to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their 
respective writings and discoveries." The patent of- 
fice is located in Washington, and here the Commis- 
sioner of Patents has his official office, and applica- 
tions for all patents are made through him, and he 
is authorized to establish regulations for the grant- 
ing and issuance of patents. The duration of a pat- 
ent right depends, of course, upon the statute. At 
the present time, the period is seventeen years, and at 
the end of that time, the person holding the patent 
must yield up his monopoly and all that pertains to it. 
A patent is in the nature of a contract, and the United 
States Supreme Court has said "The true rule of con- 
struction in respect to patents and specifications, and 
the doings generally of inventors, is to apply plain 
and ordinary principles to them, as we have endeav- 
ored to on this occasion, and not, in this most meta- 
physical branch of modern law, to yield up to subtle- 
ties and technicalities, unsuited to the subject, and 
not in keeping with the liberal spirit of the age, and 
likely to prove ruinous to a class of the community 
so inconsiderate and unskilled in business as men of 
genius and inventors usually are." A distinction is 
usually made between pioneer patents, and patents 
which are merely improvements on one already is- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 449 

sued. The former are always given a liberal in- 
terpretation, while the latter should be strictly con- 
strued. 

ELEMENT OF NOVELTY.â€” It is the element 
of novelty which gives rise to the right to a patent. 
It is not possible to discuss in this limited space, the 
countless decisions upon this point. A thing may 
be novel and entitled to a patent, although very old. 
Some lost art of the Egyptians is re-discovered by 
an American. Although the idea is several thousand 
years old, to all practical purposes it is new, and the 
inventor would be entitled to a patent. Like any 
other property, an inventor's right may be lost by 
abandonment.. Thus, where an inventor taught a 
large number of people, with no suggestion that the 
thing was an experiment, and received pay for his 
instruction, the court held that this constituted an 
abandonment of his claim, and he was not entitled 
to a patent. 

INFRINGEMENTS.â€” A suit may be main- 
tained by the owner of a patent against one who in- 
fringes, and as this is a matter under the United 
States laws, all patent suits are tried in the Federal 
courts. A patent right is personal property, and upon 
the death of the owner, goes to his personal repre- 
sentative. Patent rights, like other personal property, 
may be assigned and sold. 

SALE OF PATENTED ARTICLES.â€” In re- 
cent years, many cases have arisen over the question 
whether the manufacturers of patented articles are en- 
titled to impose conditions respecting the use of their 



450 COMMERCIAL LAW 

manufactured articles by purchasers. Early cases 
seem to support the view that, as the theory of a patent 
was that of a monopoly, these conditions would be 
upheld even after the patented articles came into the 
hands^of a purchaser. Decisions of the United States 
Supreme Court, however, have tended the other way. 
So, attaching a notice to a patented article, stating 
that the article is licensed for sale and use at a speci- 
fied price, and that the purchase is an acceptance of 
these conditions, and that in the case of a violation 
of this restriction, all rights revert back to the paten- 
tee, cannot convert an otherwise apparently unquali- 
fied sale into a mere license to use the invention. In 
Bauer v. O'Donnell, 229 U. S. 1, the Supreme Court 
said: "The right to vend conferred by the patent 
law has been exercised, and the added restriction is 
beyond the protection and purpose of the act. This 
being so, the case is brought within that line of cases 
in which this court, from the beginning, has held 
that a patentee, who has parted with a patented ma- 
chine, by passing title to a purchaser, has placed the 
article beyond the limits of the monopoly secured 
by the patent act." 

COPYRIGHTS.â€” A copyright is the exclusive 
privilege of printing, or otherwise multiplying, pub- 
lishing and selling copies of literary or artistic pro- 
ductions. The nature of a copyright is thus defined 
by the United States Supreme Court, in the case 
of Caliga v. Newspaper Co., 215 U. S. 158: "Stat- 
utory copyright is not to be confounded with the 
common law right. At common law, the exclusive 



COMMERCIAL LAW 451 

right to copy existed in the author until he permitted 
a general publication. Thus, when a book was pub- 
lished in print, the owner's common law right was 
lost. At common law, an author had a property in 
his manuscript, and might have an action against 
any one who undertook to publish it without author- 
ity. The statute created a new property right, giv- 
ing to the author, after publication, the exclusive 
right to multiply copies for a limited period. This 
statutory right is obtained in a certain way, and by 
the performance of certain acts which the statute 
points out. That is, the author having complied with 
the statute, and given up his common law right of 
exclusive duplication, prior to general publication, ob- 
tained by the method pointed out in the statute an 
exclusive right to multiply copies and publish the 
same for the term of years named in the statute. Con- 
gress did not sanction an existing right; it created a 
new one." 

PROPERTY RIGHT IN IDEAS.â€” The doc- 
trine that a person has a property right in his ideas 
has never been recognized, either by common law 
or by statute. To illustrate: If A, in the course of 
a conversation with B, gives his idea of what would 
be a brilliant thought to work up into a detective 
story, and B, possessing some literary ability, takes 
the idea and writes a successful detective story, he is 
entitled to the profits secured from the sale of the 
book, and there is nothing that A can do about it. 
The idea which A handed to B has been put by B 
into such form that it is practicable to allow B to 



452 COMMERCIAL LAW 

copyright it, and protect his property right in the 
story. There is no practical way to protect a mere 
idea. 

EFFECT OF COPYRIGHT STATUTES.â€” 
One must bear in mind the effect of copyright stat- 
utes on common law rights. At common law, an 
author has a property in his manuscript, and may 
obtain redress for any attempt to deprive him of it, 
and the copyright act provides that nothing in the 
act shall limit the right of the author, at common 
law, or in equity, to prevent the copying, publication 
or use of an unpublished work, without his consent 
and it gives him the right to damages should this 
be done. At common law, the author of any literary 
composition had an absolute property right in his 
production, and he could not be deprived of it so 
long as it remained unpublished. Interesting ques- 
tions have arisen in regard to the nature of the prop- 
erty rights in letters. The question as to the rights 
of the sender and the recipient are frequently trou- 
blesome. The rights of the writer consist in the pow- 
er to make or restrain a publication by the recipient, 
but he cannot prevent a transfer. The rights of the 
recipient are those of unqualified title in the material 
on which they are written. He has the right to keep 
them, to read them, and show them to a limited 
circle of friends, somewhat in the same way as a 
family picture album might be used. 

PROPERTY RIGHT IN INFORMATION 
OR NEWS. â€” Another interesting question is as to 
whether there can be any property right in informa- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 453 

tion or news which has been collected at great ex- 
pense by the Associated Press or some similar organ- 
ization. The most important case on this question 
is that of the Internationl News Co. v. the Associated 
Press, 248 U. S. 215. The Associated Press, organ- 
ized in New York, is a corporation created for the 
purpose of collecting news and distributing it to 
about 950 newspapers at an annual expense of about 
$3,500,000. The International News Service was a 
corporation organized in New Jersey to collect and 
sell news to a chain of newspapers. The complaint 
was made by the Associated Press that the Interna- 
tional News Service was engaged in pirating its news 
in three ways: (1) By bribing employees of news- 
papers, published by complainant's members, to fur- 
nish Associated Press news to defendant, before pub- 
lication, for transmission by telegraph and telephone 
to defendant's clients, for publication by them; sec- 
ond, by inducing Associated Press members to violate 
its by-laws and permit defendant to obtain news be- 
fore publication ; and, third, copying news from early 
editions of complainant's newspapers, and selling it, 
either bodily or after rewriting it, to defendant's cus- 
tomers." The court held that news should be re- 
garded as quasi-property, and that it was unfair com- 
petition in business for the International News Ser- 
vice to take from newspapers, which are members 
of the Associated Press, news furnished by it, and re- 
fused to modify the injunction issued by the District 
Court restraining any taking or using of the Asso- 
ciated Press news, either bodily or in substance, from 



454 COMMERCIAL LAW 

bulletins issued by the Associated Press, or any of 
its members, or from editions of its newspapers, 
until its commercial value to the complainant and all 
of its members had passed away. 

APPLICATION FOR COPYRIGHT.â€” The 
formality of securing a copyright is comparatively 
simple. The register of copyrights, in the library of 
Congress at Washington, furnishes a blank which 
the applicant fills out and returns, giving the required 
information, and on or before the first day of pub- 
lication, the applicant must send two copies of the 
copyrighted book to the library of Congress. The 
copyright is good for twenty-eight years, v/ith a right 
to renewal. The works for which copyrights may be 
secured may be classified as: (a) Books, including 
composite and cyclopedic books, directories, gazet- 
teers, and other compilations; (b) periodicals, includ- 
ing newspapers ; (c) lectures, sermons, and addresses, 
prepared for oral delivery; (d) dramatic or dramatic- 
musical compositions; (e) musical compositions; (f) 
maps; (g) works of art, models or designs for works 
of art; (h) reproductions of a work of art; (i) draw- 
ings or plastic works of scientific or technical char- 
acter; (j) photographs; (k) prints and pictorial rec- 
ords. There are certain things, which, while techni- 
cally they are under the classification we have given, 
are not subject of copyright. The opinions handed 
down by the judges of all of our courts, although 
they are in the form which would ordinarily permit 
copyright, are not subject of copyright because of the 
general principle of law that a judge receives a stated 



COMMERCIAL LAW 455 

annual salary and cannot, therefore, have any pecun- 
iary interests in the fruits of his judicial labors. This 
does not mean, however, that the opinions of the 
United States Supreme Court, for example, are not to 
be found in a copyrighted book. The Supreme Court 
Reporter, which is one of the systems of reporters 
published by the West Publishing Co. as a purely 
comm.ercial enterprise, is copyrighted by that com- 
pany. This is because of the fact that the editorial 
staff of the West Publishing Co. prepares a syllabus 
for each opinion, an exhaustive index in each volume, 
and a table of cases, and all of this matter arranged 
by that company, is subject to copyright, and they 
have the right to use the opinions of the Supreme 
Court the same as any other publisher would have. 
Again, a copyright might be refused on the grounds 
that the book on which the copyright was sought 
was an immoral or obscene writing, and therefore not 
entitled to protection of the copyright law. The word 
"Copyrighted" accompanied by the name of the copy- 
right proprietor should appear on the page opposite 
the title page, or if the article copyrighted is a pic- 
ture, the act provides that the device, accompanied 
by the initials or the symbol of the copyright proprie- 
tor, shall appear on the article. 

SUBJECTS OF COPYRIGHT.â€” In the classi- 
fication we have just given, mention is made of lec- 
tures, sermons, etc., as being the subject of copyright. 
It is held, however, that a lecture, delivered orally to 
a class of students, is not published to the extent that 
the instructor loses his right to it, although the stu- 



456 COMMERCIAL LAW 

dents may be allowed to make notes for their own 
use. In the same way, the artist does not lose his 
common law copyright by an exhibition of his pic- 
tures in his studio or in a public gallery where they 
are placed for sale. Similarly the public presentation 
of a dramatic production does not deprive the owner 
of his rights in it. The reason for this is that at 
common law the public performance of a play does 
not mean an abandonment to the public generally. 

TRADE MARKS AND TRADE NAMES.â€” A 
trade mark or trade name is a mark or symbol which 
the tradesman puts upon his goods, so that they may 
be identified and known by the public generally. A 
trade name differs from a trade mark in that it is de- 
scriptive of the manufacturer himself, and involves the 
individuality of the maker. Statutes will be found 
covering the registration of trade marks and trade 
names, but the protection which the law affords the 
owner of these is not confined to a statute alone. It 
is generally held that a trade mark, subject to some 
qualifications, arises without the aid of any statute. 

SUBJECT MATTER OF TRADE MARK OR 
TRADE NAME.â€” The question as to what is the 
subject-matter of a trade mark or a trade name, can 
only be determined by a careful reading of the cases. 
A trade mark may consist of a name, a symbol, a let- 
ter, some arbitrary form, or a newly-coined word. 
Pictures of animals, coats of arms, and the like, are 
frequently used. No trade mark can be obtained by 
the mere use of a color or generally a geographical 
term, nor can a trade mark be obtained from the form 



COMMERCIAL LAW 457 

of a package in which goods are packed, and gener- 
ally, mere letters and numbers cannot form a trade 
mark, although the arbitrary combination of num- 
bers, such as "Babbitt's 1776" may be a valid trade 
mark. 

NAMES NOT VALID TRADE MARKS.â€” 
Generic names, and merely names of articles, are not 
valid trade marks, as "Extract of Wheat," and "New 
York Cough Remedy." A trade name of a firm, a 
corporate name, or the name of a publication, al- 
though they are not strictly trade marks, are, never- 
theless, of the same nature as a trade mark, and will 
be protected in the same manner. 

UNFAIR COMPETITION.â€” The most com- 
mon way in which trade marks and trade names be- 
come the subject of litigation, is in connection with 
unfair competition. By this term we mean, ordinarily, 
the imitation by one person, for the purpose of de- 
ceiving another, of the name, device, or symbol used 
by a business rival. The courts act in such cases 
upon the theory that the public should be protected, 
and should not have other goods pawned off on it 
in place of something else which a person thinks he 
is getting. This matter of unfair competition is the 
subject of much litigation in the courts, and one or 
two illustrations will show how the question arises. 
For example: In an English case, decided in 1897, the 
plaintiff had manufactured and sold a relish which 
was made under a secret recipe and was sold under 
the name "Yorkshire Relish." The defendant then 
put a sauce on the market resembling it, and sold it 



458 COMMERCIAL LAW 

under the name of "Yorkshire Sauce." The court 
held that the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction. 
In the case of the International Silver Co. v. the Rog- 
ers Co., 66 N. J. Equity 119, the court enjoined the use 
of the word "Rogers" in the corporate title of the 
William H. Rogers Corporation, on the ground that 
its use was a part of the proceedings by which the 
public were deceived. In this case a manufacturer 
of silverware, in Plainfield, N. J., was attempting to 
trade upon the reputation of the "1847" brand of plat- 
ed silver made by the Rogers Company of Connecti- 
cut, which company was at the time of the action, 
a constituent part of the International Silver Co. 
The Connecticut Company had built up a large and 
good reputation by a long period of sales of its silver- 
ware to the public under its trade devices, and the 
use of its business name. The New Jersey Company 
was simply attempting to trade on that reputation, 
which is almost always the case in unfair competi- 
tion. 

CONFLICT OF LAW.â€” Although we have re- 
ferred to the uniform legislation in the various topics 
of commercial law which we have been considering, 
there is still much in the subject of conflict of law 
which concerns the student of commercial law. In- 
ternational law is commonly divided into two 
branches, public and private. Public is that which 
regulates the political intercourse of nations with 
each other; private, that which regulates the comity 
of States in giving effect in one to the municipal laws 
of another relating to private persons. Conflict of 



COMMERCIAL LAW 459 

law is one division of the broader subject of interna- 
tional law and is frequently called private interna- 
tional law. In the sense in which we are now using 
the term, the various States of the Union are consid- 
ered as foreign to each other. The problems embraced 
in this topic and their bearing on commercial law may 
be more fully appreciated if we take a simple illustra- 
tion. A stock broker with offices in New York City 
seeks to sell the stock of a new oil mining company 
to a purchaser in Indiana.. The sale is one v/hich is 
not allowed by the Indiana "blue sky" law. New 
York has no such law. The sale is effected by 
means of circulars and correspondence between 
the New York broker and the Indiana purchaser. 
Is this transaction to be governed by the law of 
Indiana or of New York? Its validity will de- 
pend upon our answer to that question and this 
is the type of question one has to answer on the 
subject of conflict of law. With approximately forty 
different "blue sky" laws in the country at present, 
and the great number of stock transactions carried 
on between the States, the importance of this topic 
may be appreciated. Again, even where we have a 
uniform act as, for example, the Uniform Negotiable 
Instruments Act, there are still differences in the law 
in some States. Each statute must be interpreted by 
the courts, and although the judges are sincere in 
their efforts, it can not be expected that we will al- 
ways have a uniform interpretation of the same act 
by the courts in each and every jurisdiction of the 
United States. 



460 COMMERCIAL LAW 

FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.â€” There are 
several fundamental principles we should keep in 
mind before we turn to the specific branches of com- 
mercial law as affected by our topic. The term comity 
is one of common use in conflict of law and is defined 
as the recognition which one nation or State allows 
within its territory to the legislative, executive, or 
judicial acts of another nation or state. Comity is not 
a matter of right, but a courtesy, and one country may 
exercise its right and prohibit citizens of other coun- 
tries from suing in its courts. Of course the various 
States of the United States are not as completely free 
in this matter as separate countries, because of the 
provision in the Federal Constitution guaranteeing 
to the citizens of each State all the privileges and im- 
munities of citizens in the several States. There are 
still many questions which are not affected by the 
Federal Constitution. For example, a suit is brought 
in New Jersey upon a contract of suretyship made in 
New York by a wife for her husband. There is a 
statute in New Jersey prohibiting a married woman 
from doing this. New York has no such statute. 
Shall the New Jersey court enforce the contract which 
the parties made in New York but which they could 
not have made in New Jersey? Under the principle 
of comity a New Jersey court has held valid such a 
contract. Again, it is entirely conceivable that a per- 
son living in Turkey might make a binding contract 
to marry three women at the same time. Suppose the 
Turk before the time for performing the contract ar- 
rives, comes to New York and then refuses to marry 



COMMERCIAL LAW 461 

the three women. Could they sue him for a breach 
of contract in the New York court? Clearly not. Here 
they would be asking the New York court to enforce 
a contract which while admittedly valid, when made 
in Turkey, is decidedly against the public policy of 
any monogamous country. Comity being a courtesy, 
not a right, would not require a New York court to 
recognize the Turkish contract. In our illustration 
of the wife acting as surety, no question of public 
policy was involved and hence there was no impro- 
priety in New Jersey recognizing as valid her con- 
tract, although such a contract could not have been 
made within the State of New Jersey. 

CONFLICT OF LAW AS RELATING TO 
THE STATUS OF PROPERTY.â€” As we have 
pointed out heretofore, property is divided into real 
property and personal property. Reference should 
be made to the distinctions between these two kinds 
of property as described in a preceding chapter. Sup- 
pose A dies intestate in Texas owning real property 
in New York. The law relating to the descent of real 
property is different in Texas from that in New York, 
A's heirs wish to know by which law this New York 
real estate will be governed. It is almost universally 
recognized that all matters concerning the title and 
disposition of real property are determined by what 
is known as the lex loci rei sitae, that is, the law of 
the place where the property is situated. Accordingly 
the heirs in Texas would be governed by the law of 
the State of New York and, similarly, if A had also 
owned property in Illinois, that property would be 



462 COMMERCIAL LAW 

governed by the Illinois law. Suppose, also, A had 
owned $50,000 worth of stock in various corporations 
and he kept one-half of this stock in his safe deposit 
box in Galveston and the other half in New York 
City. While the dominion of a State over personal 
property within its borders is complete, nevertheless 
by virtue of the principles of comity, the rule has been 
recognized almost from time immemorial that per- 
sonal property is governed by the law of the domicile 
of the decedent at the time of his death. Hence A's 
stocks (and bonds for that matter) would be divided 
according to the law of Texas whether they were in 
his safe deposit box in Galveston, New York City, or 
Chicago. It follows, when no rights of creditors in- 
tervene, that the law of the domicile of the testator 
will control in regard to his will of personal property, 
and the law of the place where the real property is sit- 
uate will control in regard to it. 

CONFLICT OF LAW AS RELATING TO 
CONTRACTS. â€” It is a general principle of contract 
law that the construction and validity of a contract 
is governed by the lex loci contractus, the law of the 
place where the contract is made. When the contract 
is made in one jurisdiction and is to be performed in 
another, the question becomes more difficult. The 
Supreme Court of the United States, in Scudder v. 
Union Nat. Bank, 91 U. S. 406, has laid down the fol- 
lowing rules in reference to the law governing con- 
tracts in cases in which the place of making and the 
place of performance are not the same. "1. Matters 
bearing upon the execution, interpretation and val- 



COMMERCIAL LAW 463 

idity are determined by the law of the place where the 
contract is made ; 2. Matters connected with the per- 
formance are regulated by the law of the place where 
the contract by its terms is to be performed; 3. Mat- 
ters relating to procedure depend upon the law of the 
forum (i. e., the court where the case is heard). These 
three general rules have been adopted and applied by 
many jurisdictions in a long line of cases involving 
every conceivable kind of contract. But perhaps it is 
even more generally stated, when the contract is to be 
performed in a place other than the place where it is 
made, that the law of the place where the contract is 
to be performed will determine the validity, nature, ob- 
ligation and effect of the contract, or, in other words, 
in case of conflict the lex loci solutionis (the law of 
the place of performance) will prevail over the lex 
loci contractus. Although these statements at first 
seem somev/hat contradictory, we may always apply 
another rule which is a sound test for the determina- 
tion of the proper law to be applied. We may prop- 
erly say that the intention of the parties should con- 
trol and it is generally agreed that the law of the 
place where the contract is made is, prima facie, that 
which the parties intended to govern the contract, 
and in the absence of a contrary intention ought to 
control. It frequently happens that a contract made 
in one State is sued upon in the courts of another 
State. The law governing the procedure in the trial 
of this case will be the law of the forum, that is of the 
State where the case is tried, regardless of what the 
law may be on the same matter in the State where 



464 COMMERCIAL LAW 

the contract was made. There may be, for example, 
a peculiar rule as to a wife's being able to testify on 
the contract in question. This rule will be enforced 
by the court although no such rule existed in the State 
where the contract was made. There is no great 
hardship in the application of such principles because 
the courts of the State where the contract was made 
are open to the parties, and if they wish to avail 
themselves of the services of a court in a different 
jurisdiction they must take it as they find it with its 
rules of procedure. 

ILLUSTRATION.â€” There is another type of 
contract which involves the question of conflict of 
law to which attention should be called. The facts 
in the case of Fonesca v. Cunard Steamship Company 
153 Mass. 553, illustrate this point. A passenger on 
one of the steamships of the Cunard Steamship Com- 
pany bought a ticket in Liverpool for Boston and on 
the ticket was a clause providing that the steamship 
company should not be liable for any damage to a pas- 
senger's baggage during transit, regardless of 
whether the steamship company was negligent in 
handling the baggage. When the passenger arrived 
in Boston, and her trunk was delivered, it was found 
that the contents had been damaged by sea water due 
to the steamboat company negligently leaving a port- 
hole open. The passenger sued, and the Massachu- 
setts court held there could be no recovery for the 
damage, for, although such a clause exempting a car- 
rier for his negligence was not valid under the Massa- 
chusetts law (and in fact the law of practically all 



COMMERCIAL LAW 465 

American jurisdictions), nevertheless, since the law 
of England permits such a clause, and this was an 
English contract, the ticket having been bought in 
Liverpool, the passenger was bound by the terms 
of her contract. There are many kinds of con- 
tracts of transportation of baggage, of passengers 
and of telegraph messages, involving the carrying out 
of such contracts in many different States. Not all 
of the decisions in the various States of this country 
are harmonious. We must expect to find many such 
problems in business and the answer is often one that 
requires most careful study on the part of a lawyer. 

CONFLICT OF LAW AS RELATING TO 
NEGOTIABLE PAPER.â€” There is not so large a 
field for questions of conflict of law to come up in 
negotiable paper as in some of the other topics we 
have been considering. Forty-seven States have now 
passed the Uniform Negotiable Instrument Law. But, 
as we have pointed out, the interpretation of this law 
in the various States is not invariably uniform. Sup- 
pose a promissory note has six indorsers. Every in- 
dorsement is governed by the law of the State where 
it was made, and should there be a different law in this 
matter, we would at once have a question in conflict 
of law. Again, in determining the negotiability of a 
document made in one place and payable in another, 
we have a further question in conflict of law. The 
authorities do not agree here although perhaps we 
may say the majority hold that the law of place or 
payment controls. These problems will be considered 
in the text-book on Negotiable Instruments. 



466 COMMERCIAL LAW 

CONFLICT OF LAW AS RELATING TO 
INTEREST AND USURY.â€” We find a variety of 
usury laws throughout the United States. Some few 
States allow the lender to charge any rate of interest. 
Others allow a fixed rate, usually 6%, and provide 
that the lender forfeits both principal and interest if 
he charges more. Still others allow a fixed rate and 
provide that interest only is forfeited if a higher rate 
is charged. It is easy to see that a contract made in 
one State may be sued upon in another State and the 
usury laws of the two States may be entirely differ- 
ent. We may say as a general rule that usury laws do 
not offend any principles of public policy. There is 
nothing wrong in asking a New York court, where 
the legal rate of interest is 6%, to enforce a contract 
made in a State where a higher rate is allowed. On 
the other hand, no New York court would allow citi- 
zens of New York simply to date a contract Boston, 
Massachusetts, and provide for a 10% interest rate, 
thereby hoping to evade the New York Usury law, 
when, except for the date on the contract, it was in 
reality wholly a New York contract.

 Administrative Law : Conceptual Analysis Issues and ProspectsIntroductory :-Administrative law is the bye-product of the growing socio-economic functions of the State and the increased powers of the government. Administrative law has become very necessary in the developed society, the relationship of the administrative authorities and the people have become very complex. In order to regulate thesecomplex, relations, some law is necessary, which may bring about regularity certainty and may check at the same time the misuse of powers vested in the administration. With the growth of the society, its complexity increased and thereby presenting new challenges to the administration we can have the appraisal of the same only when we make a comparative study of the duties of the administration in the ancient times with that of the modern times. In the ancient society the functions of the state were very few the prominent among them being protection from foreign invasion, levying of Taxes and maintenance of internal peace & order. It does not mean, however that there was no administrative law before 20th century. In fact administration itself is concomitant of organized Administration. In India itself, administrative law can be traced to the well-organized administration under the Mauryas and Guptas, several centuries before the Christ, following through the administrative, system of Mughals to the administration under the East India Company, the precursor of the modern administrative system. But in the modern society, the functions of the state are manifold, In fact, the modern state is regarded as the custodian of social welfare and consequently, there is not a single field of activity which is free from direct or indirect interference by the state. Along with duties, and powers the state has to shoulder new responsibilities. The growth in the range of responsibilities of the state thus ushered in an administrative age and an era of Administrative law.The development of Administrative law is an inevitable necessity of the modern times; a study of administrative law acquaints us with those rules according to which the administration is to be carried on. Administrative LawModule – 1   4
has been characterized as the most outstanding legal development of the 20th-century.Administrative Law is that branch of the law, which is concerned, with the composition of powers, duties, rights and liabilities of the various organs of the Government.The rapid growth of administrative Law in modern times is the direct result of the growth of administrative powers. The ruling gospel of the 19th century was Laissez faire which manifested itself in the theories of individualism, individual enterprise and self help. The philosophy envisages minimum government control, maximum free enterprise and contractual freedom. The state was characterized as the law and order state and its role was conceived to be negative as its internal extended primarily to defending the country from external aggression, maintaining law and order within the country dispensing justice to its subjects and collecting a few taxes to finance these activities. It was era of free enterprise. The management of social and economic life was not regarded as government responsibility. But laissez faire doctrine resulted in human misery. It came to be realized that the bargaining position of every person was not equal and uncontrolled contractual freedom led to the exploitation of weaker sections by the stronger e.g. of the labour by the management in industries. On the one hand, slums, unhealthy and dangerous conditions of work, child labour wide spread poverty and exploitation of masses, but on the other hand, concentration of wealth in a few hands, became the order of the day. It came to be recognized that the state should take active interest in ameliorating the conditions of poor. This approach gave rise to the favoured state intervention in and social control and regulation of individual enterprise. The state started to act in the interests of social justice; it assumed a “ positive” role. In course of time, out of dogma of collectivism emerged the concept of “ Social Welfare State” which lays emphasis on the role of state as a vehicle of socio-economic regeneration and welfare of the people.Thus the growth of administrative law is to be attributed to a change of philosophy as to the role and function of state. The shifting of gears from laissez faire state to social welfare state has resulted in change of role of the state. This trend may be illustrated very forcefully by reference to the position in India. Before 1947, India was a police state. The ruling foreign power was primarily interested in strengthening its own domination; the administrative machinery was used mainly with the object in view and the civil service came to be designated as the “steel frame”. The state did not concern itself much with the welfare of the people. But all this changed with the advent of independence with the philosophy in the Indian constitution the preamble to the constitution enunciates the great objectives and the socio- economic goals for the achievement of which the Indian constitution has been conceived and drafted in the mid-20th century an era when the concept of social welfare state was predominant. It is thus pervaded with the modern outlook regarding the objectives and functions of the state. it embodies a distinct philosophy which regards the state as on organ to secure good and welfare of the people this concept of state is further strengthened by theModule – 1   5
Directive Principles of state policy which set out the economic, social and political goals of Indian constitutional system. These directives confer certain non-justiceable rights on the people, and place the government under an obligation to achieve and maximize social welfare and basic social values of life education, employment, health etc. In consonance with the modern beliefs of man, the Indian constitution sets up machinery to achieve the goal of economic democracy along with political democracy, for the latter would be meaningless without former.Therefore, the attainment of socio-economic justice being a conscious goal of state policy, there is a vast and inevitable increase in the frequency with which ordinary citizens come into relationship of direct encounter with state power- holder. The Administrative law is an important weapon for bringing about harmony between power and justice. The basic law of the land i.e. the constitution governs the administrators.Administrative law essentially deals with location of power and the limitations thereupon. Since both of these aspects are governed by the constitution, we shall survey the provisions of the constitution, which act as sources of limitations upon the power of the state. This brief outline of the Indian constitution will serve the purpose of providing a proper perspective for the study of administrative law.India’s Constitution is a very lengthy, elaborate and detailed document. It consists of 395 Articles arranged under 22 parts and 9 schedules. It is probably the longest of the organic law now extant in the world. Several reasons have contributed to the prolixity of the Indian Constitution.Firstly, the Constitution deals with the organization and structure not only of the central Government but also of the states.Secondly, in a federal constitution, Center-State relationship is a matter of crucial importance. While other federal constitutions have only skeletal provisions on this matter the Indian Constitution has detailed norms.Thirdly, the Constitution has reduced to writing many unwritten conventions of the British Constitution as for example, the principle of collective responsibility of the Ministers, parliamentary procedure etc.Fourthly, there exist various communities and groups in India. To remove mutual distrust among them, it was felt necessary to include in the Constitution detailed provisions on Fundamental Rights, safeguards to minorities, Scheduled tribes scheduled castes and backward classes.                    Module – 1   6
    Fifthly, to promote the social welfare concept on which the state of India is to be based. The constitution includes Directive Principles of State Policy.Lastly, the Constitution contains not only the fundamental principles of governance but also many administrative details, such as the provisions regarding citizenship, official languages, government services, electoral machinery etc. In other constitutions, these are usually left to be regulated by the ordinary law of the land. The framers of the Indian Constitution however felt that unless these provisions were contained in the Constitution, an infant democracy might find itself in difficulties, and the smooth and efficient working of the Constitution and the democratic process in the country might be jeopardized. The form of administration has a close relation with the form of the Constitution and the former must be appropriate to the latter. It is quite possible to pervert the constitutional mechanism, without changing its form, by merely changing the form of the administration and making it inconsistent with, and opposed to, the spirit of the constitution. Since India was emerging as an independent country after a long spell of foreign rule, the country lacked democratic values. The constitution-makers therefore thought it prudent not to take unnecessary risks, and to incorporate in the constitution itself the from of administration as well, instead of leaving it to the legislature, so that the whole mechanism may become viable.The preamble to the Constitution declares India to be a Sovereign Democratic Republic. The term ‘Sovereign’ denotes that India is subject to no external authority. The term ‘democratic’ signifies that India has a parliamentary from of government, which means a government responsible to an elected legislature.The preamble to the Constitution enunciates the great objectives and the socio-economic goals for the achievement of which the Indian Constitution has been established. These are: to secure to all citizens of India social, economic and political justice; to secure to all Indian citizens liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; to secure to them equality of status and opportunity, and to promote among them fraternity so as to secure the dignity of the Individual and the unity of the nation. The Indian Constitution has been conceived and drafted in the mid-twentieth century-an era when the concept of social welfare state is predominant. It is thus pervaded with the modern outlook regarding the objectives and functions of the state. It embodies a distinct philosophy of government, and, explicitly declares that India will be organized as a social welfare state, i.e., a state that renders social services to the people and promotes their general welfare. In the formulations and decelerations of the social objectives contained in the preamble, one can            Module – 1   7
clearly discern the impact of the modern political philosophy, which regards the state as an organ to secure the good and welfare of the people. This concept of a welfare state is further strengthened by the Directive Principles of State Policy, which set out the economic, social and political goals of the Indian constitutional system. These directives confer certain non-justiceable rights on the people, and place the governments under an obligation to achieve and maximize social welfare and basic social values like education, employment, health etc. In consonance with the modern beliefs of man, the Indian Constitution sets up a machinery to achieve the goal of economic democracy along with political democracy, for the latter would be meaningless without the former in a poor country like India.India is a country of religions. There exist multifarious religious groups in the country but, in spite of this, the Constitution stands for a secular state of India.. The essential basis of the Indian Constitution is that all citizens are equal, and that the religion of a citizen is entirely irrelevant in the matter of his fundamental rights. The Constitution answers equal freedom for all religions and provide that the religion of the citizen has nothing to do in socio-economic maters.The Indian Constitution has a chapter on Fundamental Rights and thus guarantees to the people certain basic rights and freedoms, such as, inter alia, equal protection of laws, freedom of speech and expression freedom of worship and religion. Freedom of assembly and association, freedom to move freely and to reside and settle an where in India, freedom to follow any occupation, trade or business, freedom of person, freedom against double jeopardy and against export facto laws. Untouchables, the age-old scourge afflicting the Hindu society, have been formally abolished. The people can claim their Fundamental Rights against the state subject to some restrictions, which the state can impose in the interests of social control. These restrictions on Fundamental Rights are expressly mentioned in the Constitution itself and, therefore, these rights can be qualified or a bridged only to the extent laid down. These rights, in substance, constitute inhibitions on the legislative and executive organs of the state. No law or executive action infringing a Fundamental Right can be regarded as valid. In this way, the Constitution demarcates an area of individual freedom and liberty wherein government cannot interfere. The judiciary ensures an effective and speedy enforcement of these rights. Since the inauguration of the Constitution, many significant legal battles have been fought in the area of Fundamental Rights and, thus, a mass of interesting case law has come into being in this area.The Indian society lacks homogeneity, as there exist differences of religion, language, culture, etc. There are sections of people who are comparatively weaker than others-economically, socially and culturally and their lot can be ameliorated only when the state makes a special effort to that end. Mutual suspicion and distrust exist between various religious and linguistic groups. To promote a sense of security among the minorities, to ameliorate the conditions of the depressed and backward classes, to make them useful members of society, to weld the diverse elements into one national andModule – 1   8
political stream, the Constitution contains a liberal scheme of safeguards to minorities, backward classes and scheduled castes. Provisions have thus been made, inter alia, to reserve seats in the State Legislatures and Lok Sabha and to make reservations services, for some of these groups, to promote the welfare of the depressed and backward classes and to protect the languages and culture of the minorities.India has adopted adult suffrage as a basis of elections to the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies. Every citizen, male or female, who has reached the age of 18 years or over, has a right to vote without any discrimination. It was indeed a very bold step on the part of the constitution- makers to adopt adult suffrage in a country of teeming millions of illiterate people, but they did so for some very sound reasons. If democracy is to be broad-based and the system of government is to have the ultimate sanction of the people as a whole, in a country like India where large masses of people are poor an illiterate, the introduction of any property or educational qualification for exercising the franchise would have amounted to a negation of democratic principles. Any such qualification would have disenfranchised a large number of depressed people. Further, it cannot be assumed that a person with a bare elementary education is in a better position to exercise the franchise are and choose his representatives accordingly.A notable feature of the Constitution is that it accords a dignified and crucial position to the judiciary. Well-ordered and well-regulated judicial machinery had been introduced in the country with the Supreme Court at the apex. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is very broadly worded. It is a general court of appeal from the High Court, is the ultimate arbiter in all-constitutional matters and enjoys an advisory jurisdiction. It can hear appears from any court or tribunal in the country and can issue writ for enforcing the Fundamental Rights. There is thus a good deal of truth in the assertion that the highest court in any other federation. There is a High Court in each State. The High Courts have wide jurisdiction and have been constituted into important instruments of justice. The most signification aspect of their jurisdiction is the power to issue writs.The judiciary in India has been assigned role to play. It has to dispense justice not only between one person and another, but also between the state and the citizens. It interprets the constitution and acts as its protector and guardian by keeping all authorities legislative, executive, administrative, judicial and quasi- judicial-within bounds. The judiciary is entitled to scrutinize any governmental action in order to assess whether or to it conforms to the constitution and the valid laws made there under. The judiciary has powers to protect people’s Fundamental Rights from any unreasonable encroachment by any organ of the state. The judiciary supervises the administrative process in the country, and acts as the balance wheel of federalism by settling disputes between the center and the states or among the state inter se.India’s Constitution is of the federal type. It established a dual polity, a two tierModule – 1   9
governmental system with the Central Government at one level and the state Governments at the other. The Constitution marks off the sphere of action of each level of government by devising an elaborate scheme of distribution of legislative, administrative, and financial powers between the Centre and the States. A government is entitled to act within its assigned field and cannot go out of it, or encroach on the field assigned to the other government.Thus the Constitution of India is having significant effect on laws including administrative law. It is under this fundamental laws are made and executed, all governmental authorities and the validity of their functioning adjudged. No legislature can make a law and no governmental agency can act, contrary to the constitution no act, executive, legislative, judicial or quasi- judicial, of any administrative agency can stand if contrary to the constitution. The constitution thus conditions the whole government process in the country. The judiciary is obligated to see any governmental organ does not violate the provisions of the constitution. This function of the judiciary entitles it to be called as guardian of the constitution.Today in India, the Administrative process has grown so much that it will not be out of place to say that today we are not governed but administered. It may be pointed out that the constitutional law deals with fundamentals while administrative with details. The learned author, Sh. I.P. Messey, has rightly pointed out, whatever may be the arguments and counter arguments, the fact remains that the administrative law is recognized as separate, independent branch of legal discipline,. Though at times the disciplines of constitutional law and administrative law may over lap. Further clarifying the point he said the correct position seems to be that if one draws two circles of administrative law and constitutional law at a certain place they may over lap and this area may termed as watershed in administrative law.In India, in the Watershed one can include the whole control mechanism provided in the constitution for the control of the administrative authorities that is article 32, 226,136,300 and 311.Need for the Administrative Law: Its Importance And FunctionsThe emergence of the social welfare has affected the democracies very profoundly. It has led to state activism. There has occurred a phenomenal increase in the area of sate operation; it has taken over a number of functions, which were previously left to private enterprise. The state today Module – 1   10
pervades every aspect of human life. The functions of a modern state may broadly be placed into five categories, viz, the state as:-Administration is the all-pervading feature of life today.The province of administration is wide and embrace following things within its ambit:-The advantage of the administrative process is that it could evolve new techniques, processes and instrumentalities, acquire expertise and specialization, to meet and handle new complex problems of modern society. Administration has become a highly complicated job needing a good deal of technical knowledge, expertise and know-how. Continuous experimentation and adjustment of detail has become an essential requisite of modern administration. If a certain rule is found to be unsuitable in practice, a new rule incorporating the lessons learned from experience has to be supplied. The Administration can change an unsuitable rule without much delay. Even if it is dealing with a problem case by case (as does a court), it could change its approach according to the exigency of the situation and the demands of justice. Such a flexibility of approach is not possible in the case of the legislative or the judicial process. Administration has assumed such an extensive, sprawling and varied character, that it is not now easy to define the term “ administration” or to evolve a general norm to identify an administrative body. It does not suffice to say that an administrative body is one, which administers, for the administration does not only put the law into effect, but does much more; it legislates and adjudicates. At times, administration is explained in a negative manner by saying that what does not fall within the purview of the legislature or the judiciary is administration.     •  protector,•  provider,•  entrepreneur,•  economic controller and•  arbiter.     •  It makes policies,•  It provides leadership to the legislature,•  It executes and administers the law and•  It takes manifold decisions.•  It exercises today not only the traditional functions ofadministration, but other varied types of functions as well.•  It exercises legislative power and issues a plethora of rules,bye- laws and orders of a general nature.     Module – 1 11
In such a context, a study of administrative law becomes of great significance. The increase in administrative functions has created a vast new complex of relations between the administration and the citizen. The modern administration impinges more and more on the individual; it has assumed a tremendous capacity to affect the rights and liberties of the people. There is not a moment of a person’s existence when he is not in contact with the administration in one-way or the other. This circumstance has posed certain basic and critical questions for us to consider:•  Does arming the administration with more and more powers keep in view the interests of the individual?•  Are adequate precautions being taken to ensure that the administrative agencies follow in discharging their functions such procedures as are reasonable, consistent with the rule of law, democratic values and natural justice?•  Has adequate control mechanism been developed so as to ensure that the administrative powers are kept within the bounds of law, and that it would not act as a power drunk creature, but would act only after informing its own mind, weighing carefully the various issues involved and balancing the individual’s interest against the needs of social control?It has increasingly become important to control the administration, consistent with the efficiency, in such a way that it does not interfere with impunity with the rights of the individual. Between individual liberty and government, there is an age-old conflict the need for constantly adjusting the relationship between the government and the governed so that a proper balance may be evolved between private interest and public interest. it is the demand of prudence that when sweeping powers are conferred on administrative organs, effective control- mechanism be also evolved so as ensure that the officers do not use their powers in an undue manner or for an unwarranted purpose. It is the task of administrative law to ensure that the governmental functions are exercised according to law, on proper legal principles and according to rules of reason and justice fairness to the individual concerned is also a value to be achieved along with efficient administrationThe goal of administrative law is to redress this inequality to ensure that, so far as possible, the individual and the state are placed on a plane of equality before the bar of justice. In reality there is no antithesis between a strong government and controlling the exercise ofModule – 1   12
administrative powers. Administrative powers are exercised by thousands of officials and affect millions of people Administrative efficiency cannot be the end-all of administrative powers. There is also the questions of protecting individual’s rights against bad administration will lead to good administration.A democracy will be no better than a mere façade if the rights of the people are infringed with impunity without proper redressed mechanism. This makes the study of administrative law important in every country. For India, however, it is of special significance because of the proclaimed objectives of the Indian polity to build up a socialistic pattern of society. This has generated administrative process, and hence administrative law, on a large scale. Administration in India is bound to multiply further and at a quick pace. If exercised properly, the vast powers of the administration may lead to the welfare state; but, if abused, they may lead to administrative despotism and a totalitarian state A careful and systematic study and development of administrative law becomes a desideratum as administrative law is an instrument of control of the exercise of administrative powers.Nature and Definition of administrative LawAdministrative Law is, in fact, the body of those which rules regulate and control the administration. Administrative Law is that branch of law that is concerned with the composition of power, duties, rights and liabilities of the various organs of the Government that are engaged in public administration. Under it, we study all those rules laws and procedures that are helpful in properly regulating and controlling the administrative machinery.There is a great divergence of opinion regarding the definition/conception of administrative law. The reason being that there has been tremendous increase in administrative process and it is impossible to attempt any precise definition of administrative law, which can cover the entire range of administrative process. Module – 1   13
Let us consider some of the definitions as given by the learned jurists.Austin has defined administrative Law. As the law, which determines the ends and modes to which the sovereign power shall be exercised. In his view, the sovereign power shall be exercised either directly by the monarch or directly by the subordinate political superiors to whom portions of those are delegated or committed in trust.Holland regards Administrative Law “one of six” divisions of public law. In his famous book “Introduction to American Administrative Law 1958”,Bernard Schawartz has defined Administrative Law as “the law applicable to those administrative agencies which possess of delegated legislation and ad judicatory authority.”Jennings has defined Administrative Law as “the law relating to the administration. It determines the organization, powers and duties of administrative authorities.”Dicey in 19th century defines it as.Firstly, portion of a nation’s legal system which determines the legal statues and liabilities of all State officials.Secondly, defines the right and liabilities of private individuals in their dealings with public officials.Thirdly, specifies the procedure by which those rights and liabilities are enforced.This definition suffers from certain imperfections. It does not cover several aspects of administrative law, e.g. it excludes the study of several administrative authorities such as public corporations which are not included within the expression “State officials,” it excludes the study of various powers and functions of administrative authorities and their control. His definition is mainly concerned with one aspect of administrative. Law, namely, judicial control of public officials.A famous jurist Hobbes has written that there was a time when the society was in such a position that man did not feel secured in it. The main reason for this was that there were no such things as administrative powers. Each person had to live in society on the basis of his own might accordingly to Hobbes, “ In such condition, there was no place for industry, arts, letters and society. Worst of all was the continual fear of danger, violent death and life of man solitary poor, nasty and brutish and short.The jurists are also of the view that might or force as a means for the enforcement of any decision by man could continue only for some time. To put it is other words, the situation of “might is right” was only temporary. It Module – 1   14
may be said to be a phase of development. This can be possible only through the medium of law. Hence, law was made and in order to interpret it and in order to determine the rights and duties on the basis of such interpretation, this work was entrusted to a special organ that we now call judiciary. The organ, which was given the function of enforcing the decision of judicial organ, is called executive. It has comparatively a very little concern with the composition of the executive organ.K.C. Davis has defined administrative law in the following words:“ Administrative Law is the law concerning the powers and procedures of administrative agencies including specially the law governing judicial review of administrative action.”In the view of Friedman, Administrative Law includes the following.•  The legislative powers of the administration both at commonlaw and under a vast mass of statutes.•  The administrative powers of the administration.•  Judicial and quasi-judicial powers of the administration, all ofthem statutory.•  The legal liability of public authorities.•  The powers of the ordinary courts to supervise theadministrative authorities.The Indian Institution of Law has defined Administrative Law in the following words;“ Administrative Law deals with the structure, powers and functions of organs of administration, the method and procedures followed by them in exercising their powers and functions, the method by which they are controlled and the remedies which are available to a person against them when his rights are infringed by their operation.”A careful perusal of the above makes it clear that Administrative Law deals with the following problems:A. B.C. D. E.Who are administrative authorities?What is the nature and powers exercised by administrative authorities?What are the limitations, if any, imposed on these powers? How the administration is kept restricted to its laminose? What is the procedure followed by the administrative authorities? Module – 115
F. What remedies are available to persons adversely affected by administration?Thus the concept of administrative law has assumed great importance and remarkable advances in recent times. There are several principles of administrative law, which have been evolved by the courts for the purpose of controlling the exercise of power. So that it does not lead to arbitrariness or despotic use of power by the instrumentalities or agencies of the state. During recent past judicial activism has become very aggressive. It was born out of desire on the part of judiciary to usher in rule of law society by enforcing the norms of good governance and thereby produced a rich wealth of legal norms and added a new dimension to the discipline administrative law.In view of above discussion we can derive at the following conclusions so far as nature and scope of administrative law is concerned: -        The administrative law has growing importance and interest and the administrative law is the most outstanding phenomena in the welfare state of today. Knowledge of administrative law is as important for the officials responsible for carrying on administration as for the students of law.    Administrative law is not codified like the Indian Penal code or the law of Contracts. It is based on the constitution. No doubt the Court of Law oversees and ensure that the law of the land is     enforced. However, the “very factor of a rapid development and complexity which gave rise to regulation made specific and complete treatment by legislation impossible and, instead, made necessary the choice of the body of officers who could keep abreast of the novelties and intricacies which the problems presented.”            Administrative law is essentially Judge made law. It is a branch of public law as compared to private law-relations inter-se. Administrative law is an ever-expanding subject in developing society and is bound to grow in size as well as quality in coming the decades. We need an efficient regulatory system, which ensures adequate protection of the people’s Rights.        Principles of administrative law emerge and development whenever any person becomes victim of arbitrary exercise of Module – 1 16
public power. Therefore administrative law deals with relationship individual with power.Sources of Administrative Law        The administrative agencies derive their authority from constitutional law and statutory law. The laws made by such agencies in exercise of the powers conferred on them also regulate their action. The principle features are: (a) transfer of power by legislature to administrative authorities, (b) exercise of power by such agencies, and (c) judicial review of administrative decisions.        Administrative law relates to individual rights as well as public needs and ensures transparent, open and honest governance, which is more people-friendly.        Inadequacy of the traditional Court to respond to new challenges has led to the growth of administrative adjudicatory process. The traditional administration of justice is technical, expensive and dilatory and is not keeping pace with the dynamics of ever- increasing subject matter. Because of limitation of time, the technical nature of legislation, the need for flexibility, experimentations and quick action resulted in the inevitable growth of administrative legislative process.            Administrative law deals with the organization and powers of administrative and powers quasi-administrative agencies        Administrative law primarily concerns with official action and the procedure by which the official action is reached.        Administrative law includes the control mechanism (judicial review) by which administrative authorities are kept within bounds and made effective.  Module – 117
There are four principal sources of administrative law in India:-•  Constitution of India•  Acts and Statutes•  Ordinances, Administrative directions, notifications and Circulars•  Judicial decisionsFuture Role of Administrative LawThe administrative law has come to stay because it provides an instrument ofcontrol of the exercise of administrative powers. The administrative law has toseek balance between the individual right and public needs. As we know inthe society there exists conflict between power and justice wherever there ispower, there exist probabilities of excesses in exercise of the power. One wayis to do nothing about this and let the celebrated Kautilyan Matsanayaya (bigfish eating little fish) prevail. The other way is to try and combat this.Administrative law identifies the excesses of power and endeavors to combatthere. The learned Author, Upender Baxi, while commenting on theadministrative law has rightly observed in. (The Myth and reality of the Indianadministrative law, Introduction by Upendra Baxi in administrative law ed. by I.P. Massey 2001 at XVIII)“to understand the stuff of which administrative law is made one has to understand relevant domains of substantive law to which courts apply the more general principles of legality and fairness. In this way a thorough study of administrative law is in effect, a study of the Indian legal system a whole. More importantly, it is study of the pathology of power in a developing society.”Growth in science and technology and modernization has resulted in great structural changes accompanied with increase in the aspirations of people as to quality of life. We know socio-eco-politico and multi dimensional problems which people face due to technological development cannot solved except by the growth of administration and the law regulating administration. No doubt the principles evolved by the court for the purpose of controlling the misuse of governmental of power is satisfactory. Yet it is said that the administrative law in India is an instrument in the hands of middle class Indians to combat administrative authoritarianism through the instrumentality of the court and there is need to make administrative law a shield for the majority of Indians living in rural area and people under poverty line. Therefore easy access to justice is considered important form of accountability this may include  informal procedure,Module – 1   18 
  speedy and less expensive trial,   legal aid,   public interest litigation,   easy bail etc.Further, the multifarious activities of the state extended to every social problems of man such as health education employment, old age pension production, control and distribution of commodities and other operations public utilities. This enjoins a new role for administration and also for the development of administrative law.Separation of PowersThe doctrine of Separation of Powers is of ancient origin. The history ofth th The origin of the doctrine is traceable to Aristotle. In the 16 and 17Centuries, French philosopher John Boding and British Politician Locke respectively had expounded the doctrine of separation of powers. But it was Montesquieu, French jurist, who for the first time gave it a systematic and scientific formulation in his book ‘Esprit des Lois’ (The spirit of the laws).Montesquieu’s view Montesquieu said that if the Executive and the Legislature are the same person or body of persons, there would be a danger of the Legislature enacting oppressive laws which the executive will administer to attain its own ends, for laws to be enforced by the same body that enacts them result in arbitrary rule and makes the judge a legislator rather than an interpreter of law. If one person or body of persons could exercise both the executive and judicial powers in the same matter, there would be arbitrary powers, which would amount to complete tyranny, if the legislative power would be added to the power of that person. The value of the doctrine lies in the fact that it seeks to preserve human liberty by avoiding the concentration of powers in one person or body of persons. The different organs of government should thus be prevented from encroaching on the province of the other organ.This theory has had different application in France, USA and England. In France, it resulted in the rejection of the power of the courts to review acts of the legislature or the executive. The existence of separate administrative Module – 1   19
courts to adjudicate disputes between the citizen and the administration owes its origin to the theory of separating of powers. The principle was categorically adopted in the making of the Constitution of the United States of America. There, the executive power is vested in the president. Article the legislative power in congress and the judicial power in the Supreme Court and the courts subordinates thereto. The President is not a member of the Congress. He appoints his secretaries on the basis not of their party loyalty but loyalty to himself. His tenure does not depend upon the confidence of the Congress in him. He cannot be removed except by impeachment, However, the United States constitution makes departure from the theory of strict separation of powers in this that there is provision for judicial review and the supremacy of the ordinary courts over the administrative courts or tribunals.In the British Constitution the Parliament is the Supreme legislative authority. At the same time, it has full control over the Executive. The harmony between the Legislator and the (Executive) is secured through the Cabinet. The Cabinet is collectively responsible to the Parliament. The Prime Minister is the head of the party in majority and is the Chief Executive authority. He forms the Cabinet. The Legislature and the Executive are not quite separate and independent in England, so far as the Judiciary is concerned its independence has been secured by the Act for Settlement of 1701 which provides that the judges hold their office during good behaviour, and are liable to be removed on a presentation of addresses by both the Houses of Parliament. They enjoy complete immunity in regard to judicial acts.In India, the executive is part of the legislature. The President is the head of the executive and acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Article 53 and 74 (1) He can be impeached by Parliament. Article 56 (1) (b) read with Art 61, Constitution. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha Article 75 (3) and each minister works during the pleasure of the President. Article 75 (2) If the Council of Ministers lose the confidence of the House, it has to resign.Functionally, the President’s or the Governor’s assent is required for all legislations. (Articles 111,200 and Art 368). The President or the Governor has power of making ordinances when both Houses of the legislature are not in session. (Articles 123 and 212). This is legislative power, and an ordinance has the same status as that of a law of the legislature. (AK Roy v Union of India AIR 1982 SC 710) The President or the Governor has the power to grant pardon (Articles 72 and 161) The legislature performs judicial function while committing for contempt those who defy its orders or commit breach of privilege (Articles 105 (3) 194 (3) Thus, the executive is dependent on the Legislature and while it performs some legislative functions such as subordinate it, also performs some executive functions such as those required for maintaining order in the house.There is, however, considerable institutional separation between the judiciary and the other organs of the government. (See Art 50) Module – 1 20
The Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief justice of India and such of the judges of the supreme Court and the High Courts as he may deem necessary for the purpose. (Article 124 (2))The Judges of the High Court are appointed by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the state, and, in the case of appointment of a judge other than the Chief justice, the Chief Justice of the High Court( Article 217 (1).)It has now been held that in making such appointments, the opinion of the Chief justice of India shall have primacy. (Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association.) The judges of the high Court and the judges of the Supreme Court cannot be removed except for misconduct or incapacity and unless an address supported by two thirds of the members and absolute majority of the total membership of the House is passed in each House of Parliament and presented to the President Article 124 (3) An impeachment motion was brought against a judge of the Supreme court, Justice Ramaswami, but it failed to receive the support of the prescribed number of members of Parliament. The salaries payable to the judges are provided in the Constitution or can be laid down by a law made by Parliament. Article 125 (1) and Art 221 (1).Every judge shall be entitled to such privileges and allowances and to such rights in respect of absence and pension, as may from time to time be determined by or under any law made by Parliament and until so determined, to such privileges, allowance and rights as are specified in the Second Schedule. Neither the privileges nor the allowance nor his rights in respect of leave of absence or pension shall be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment.Appointments of persons to be, and the posting and promotion of, district judges in any state shall be made by the Governor of the State in consultation with the High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to such state (Article 233) The control over the subordinate courts is vested in the acts of the Legislature as well as the executive. The Supreme Court has power to make rules (Article 145) and exercises administrative control over its staff.The judiciary has power to enforce and interpret laws and if they are found in violation of any provision of the Constitution, it can declare them un- constitutional and therefore, void. It can declare the executive action void if it is found against any provisions of the Constitution. Article 50 provides that the State shall take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive.Thus, the three organs of the Government (i.e. the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary) are not separate. Actually the complete demarcation of the functions of these organs of the Government is not possible. Module – 1 21
The Constitution of India does not recognize the doctrine of separation ofpower in its absolute rigidity, but the functions of the three organs of thegovernment have been sufficiently differentiated.( Ram Jawaya v. State of Punjab,AIR 1955 SC 549) None of the three of organs of the Government can take overthe functions assigned to the other organs.( Keshanand Bharti v. State of Kerala, AIR 1973 SC 1461, Asif Hameed v. State of J&K 1989 AIR, SC 1899)In State of Bihar v. Bihar Distillery Ltd., (AIR 1997 SC 1511) the Supreme Court has held that the judiciary must recognize the fundamental nature and importance of the legislature process and must accord due regard and deference to it. The Legislative and Executive are also expected to show due regard and deference to the judiciary. The Constitution of India recognizes and gives effect to the concept of equality between the three organs of the Government. The concept of checks and balance is inherent in the scheme.RULE OF LAWThe Expression “ Rule of Law” plays an important role in the administrative law. It provides protection to the people against the arbitrary action of the administrative authorities. The expression ‘rule of law’ has been derived from the French phrase ‘la Principle de legality’. i.e. a government based on the principles of law. In simple words, the term ‘rule of law, indicates the state of affairs in a country where, in main, the law rules. Law may be taken to mean mainly a rule or principle which governs the external actions of the human beings and which is recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice.Rule of Law is a dynamic concept.It does not admit of being readily expressed. Hence, it is difficult to define it. Simply speaking, it means supremacy of law or predominance of law and essentially, it consists of values.The concept of the rule of Law is of old origin. Edward Coke is said to be the originator of this concept, when he said that the King must be under God and Law and thus vindicated the supremacy of law over the pretensions of the executives. Prof. A.V. Dicey later developed on this concept in the course of his lectures at the Oxford University. Dicey was an individualist; he wrote about the concept of the Rule of law at the end of the golden Victorian era of laissez-faire in England. That was the reason why Dicey’s concept of the Rule of law contemplated the absence of wide powers in the hands of Module – 1   22
government officials. According to him, wherever there is discretion there is room for arbitrariness. Further he attributed three meanings to Rule of Law.(1) The First meaning of the Rule of Law is that ‘no man is punishable or can lawfully be made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary courts of the land. (The view of Dicey, quoted by Garner in his Book on ‘Administrative Law’.)(2) The Second Meaning of the Rule of Law is that no man is above law. Every man whatever be his rank or condition. is subject to the ordinary law of the realm and amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals (Ibid).(3) The Third meaning of the rule of law is that the general principle of theconstitution are the result of judicial decisions determining the rights of privatepersons in particular cases brought before the court. (View of Dicey, quoted by Garner in his book on Administrative Law, p.11.)The view of Dicey as to the meaning of the Rule of Law has been subject of much criticism. The whole criticism may be summed up as follows.Dicey has opposed the system of providing the discretionary power to the administration. In his opinion providing the discretionary power means creating the room for arbitrariness, which may create as serious threat to individual freedom. Now a days it has been clear that providing the discretion to the administration is inevitable. The opinion of the Dicey, thus, appears to be outdated as it restricts the Government action and fails to take note of the changed conception of the Government of the State.Dicey has failed to distinguish discretionary powers from the arbitrary powers. Arbitrary power may be taken as against the concept of Rule of Law . In modern times in all the countries including England, America and India, the discretionary powers are conferred on the Government. The present trend is that discretionary power is given to the Government or administrative authorities, but the statute which provides it to the Government or the administrative officers lays down some guidelines or principles according to which the discretionary power is to be exercised. The administrative law is much concerned with the control of the discretionary power of the administration. It is engaged in finding out the new ways and means of the control of the administrative discretion.According to Dicey the rule of law requires that every person should be subject to the ordinary courts of the country. Dicey has claimed that there is no separate law and separate court for the trial of the Government servants in England. He critcised the system of droit administratif prevailing in France. In France there are two types of courts Administrative Court and Ordinary Civil Courts. The disputes between the citizens and the Administration are decided by the Administrative courts while the other cases, (i.e. the disputes between the citizens) are decided by the Civil Court. Dicey was very critical to the separation for deciding the disputes between the administration and the citizensModule – 1   23
According to Dicey the Rule of Law requires equal subjection of all persons to the ordinary law of the country and absence of special privileges for person including the administrative authority. This proportion of Dicey does not appear to be correct even in England. Several persons enjoy some privileges and immunities. For example, Judges enjoy immunities from suit in respect of their acts done in discharge of their official function. Besides, Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, has provided special protection to the official. Foreign diplomats enjoy immunity before the Court. Further, the rules of ‘public interest privilege may afford officials some protection against orders for discovery of documents in litigation.’ Thus, the meaning of rule of law taken by Dicey cannot be taken to be completely satisfactory.Third meaning given to the rule of law by Dicey that the constitution is the result of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons in particular cases brought before the Courts is based on the peculiar character of the Constitution of Great Britain.In spite of the above shortcomings in the definition of rule of law by Dicey, he must be praised for drawing the attention of the scholars and authorities towards the need of controlling the discretionary powers of the administration. He developed a philosophy to control the Government and Officers and to keep them within their powers. The rule of law established by him requires that every action of the administration must be backed by law or must have been done in accordance with law. The role of Dicey in the development and establishment of the concept of fair justice cannot be denied.The concept of rule of law, in modern age, does not oppose the practice of conferring discretionary powers upon the government but on the other hand emphasizing on spelling out the manner of their exercise. It also ensures that every man is bound by the ordinary laws of the land whether he be private citizens or a public officer; that private rights are safeguarded by the ordinary laws of the land (See Journal of the Indian law Institute, 1958-59, pp. 31-32)Thus the rule of law signifies that nobody is deprived of his rights and liberties by an administrative action; that the administrative authorities perform their functions according to law and not arbitrarily; that the law of the land are not unconstitutional and oppressive; that the supremacy of courts is upheld and judicial control of administrative action is fully secured.Basic Principles of the Rule of Law•  Law is Supreme, above everything and every one. No body is the above law.•  All things should be done according to law and not according to whim•  No person should be made to suffer except for a distinct breach of law.•  Absence of arbitrary power being hot and sole of rule of law•  Equality before law and equal protection of law Module – 1 24
•  Discretionary should be exercised within reasonable limits set by law•  Adequate safeguard against executive abuse of powers•  Independent and impartial Judiciary•  Fair and Justice procedure•  Speedy TrialRule of Law and Indian ConstitutionIn India the Constitution is supreme. The preamble of our Constitution clearly sets out the principle of rule of law.It is sometimes said that planning and welfare schemes essentially strike at rule of law because they affect the individual freedoms and liberty in may ways. But rule of law plays an effective role by emphasizing upon fair play and greater accountability of the administration. It lays greater emphasis upon the principles of natural justice and the rule of speaking order in administrative process in order to eliminate administrative arbitrariness.Rule of Law and Case lawIn an early case S.G. Jaisinghani V. Union of India and others, (AIR 1967 SC 1427) the Supreme Court portrayed the essentials of rule of law in a very lucid manner. It observed: “ The absence of arbitrary power is the first essential of the rule of law upon which our whole constitutional system is based. In a system governed by rule of law, discretion when conferred upon executive authorities must be continued within clearly defined limits. The rule of law from this points of view means that decisions should be made by the application of known principles and rules and, in general such decision should be predictable and the citizen should know where he is. If a decision is taken without any principle or without any rule it is unpredictable and such a decision is antithesis of a decision taken in accordance with the rule of law”.The Supreme Court in a case, namely, Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association V. Union of India, (AIR 1994 SC 268 at p.298) reiterated that absence of arbitrariness is one of the essentials of rule of law. The Court observed. “For the rule of law to be realistic there has to be rooms for discretionary authority within the operation of rule of law even though it has to be reduced to the minimum extent necessary for proper, governance, and within the area of discretionary authority, the existence of proper guidelines or norms of general application excludes any arbitrary exercise of discretionary authority. In such a situation, the exercise of discretionary authority in its application to individuals, according to proper guidelines and norms, further reduces the area of discretion, but to that extent discretionary authority has to be given to make the system workable.The recent expansion of rule of law in every field of administrative functioning has assigned it is a place of special significance in the Indian administrativeModule – 1   25
law. The Supreme Court, in the process of interpretation of rule of law vis-à- vis operation of administrative power, in several cases, emphasized upon the need of fair and just procedure, adequate safeguards against any executive encroachment on personal liberty, free legal aid to the poor and speedy trail in criminal cases as necessary adjuncts to rule of law. Giving his dissenting opinion in the Death penalty case, Mr. Justice Bhagwati explains fully the significance of rule of law in the following words:The rule of law permeates the entire fabric of the Constitution and indeed forms one of its basic features. The rule of law excludes arbitrariness, its postulate is ‘intelligence without passion’ and reason free from desire. Wherever we find arbitrariness or unreasonableness there is denial of the rule of law. Law in the context of rule of law does not mean any law enacted by legislative authority, howsoever arbitrary, despotic it may be, otherwise even in dictatorship it would be possible to say that there is rule of law because every law made by the dictator, however arbitrary and unreasonable, has to be obeyed and every action has to be taken in conformity with such law. In such a case too even where the political set-up is dictatorial it is the law that governs the relationship between menThe modern concept of the Rule of Law is fairly wide and, therefore, sets up an idea for government to achieve. This concept was developed by the International Commission of Jurists, known as Delhi Declaration, 1959, which was later on confirmed at Lagos in 1961. According to this formulation, the Rule of Law implies that the functions of the government in a free society should be so exercised as to create conditions in which the dignity of man as an individual is upheld.During the last few years the Supreme Court in India has developed some fine principles of Third World jurisprudence. Developing the same new constitutionalism further, the Apex Court in Veena Seth v. State (AIR 1983 SC 339) of Bihar extended the reach of the Rule of Law to the poor and the downtrodden, the ignorant and the illiterate, who constitute the bulk of humanity in India, when it ruled that the Rule of Law does not exist merely for those who have the means to fight for their rights and very often do so for the perpetuation of the status quo, which protects and preserves their dominance and permits them to exploit a large section of the community. The opportunity for this ruling was provided by a letter written by the Free Legal Aid Committee, Hazaribagh, Bihar drawing its attention to unjustified and illegal detention of certain prisoners in jail for almost two or three decades.Recent aggressive judicial activism can only be seen as a part of the efforts of the Constitutional Courts in India to establish rule-of-law society, which implies that no matter how high a person, may be the law is always above him. Court is also trying to identify the concept of rule of law with human rights of the people. The Court is developing techniques by which it can force the government not only to submit to the law but also to create conditions where people can develop capacities to exercise their rights properly and meaningfully. The public administration is responsible for effective implementation of rule of law and constitutional commands, which effectuateModule – 1   26
fairly the objective standards laid down by law. Every public servant is a trustee of the society and is accountable for due effectuation of constitutional goals. This makes the concept of rule of law highly relevant to our context.Droit AdministratifMeaning of Droit administratif French administrative law is known as Droit Administratif which means a body of rules which determine the organization, powers and duties of public administration and regulate the relation of the administration with the citizen of the country. Droit Administrative does not represent the rules and principles enacted by Parliament. It contains the rules developed by administrative courts.Napoleon Bonaparte was the founder of the Droit administrative. It was he who established the Conseil d’Etat. He passed an ordinance depriving the law courts of their jurisdiction on administrative matters and another ordinance that such matters could be determined only by the Conseil d’Etat.Waline, the French jurist, propounds three basic principles of Droit administrative:1. the power of administration to act suo motu and impose directly on the subject the duty to obey its decision;2. the power of the administration to take decisions and to execute them suo motu may be exercised only within the ambit of law which protects individual liberties against administrative arbitrariness;3. the existence of a specialized administrative jurisdiction.One good result of this is that an independent body reviews every administrative action The Conseil d’Etat is composed of eminent civil servants, deals with a variety of matters like claim of damages for wrongful acts of Government servants, income-tax, pensions, disputed elections, personal claims of civil servants against the State for wrongful dismissal or suspension and so on. It has interfered with administrative orders on the ground of error of law, lack of jurisdiction, irregularity of procedure and detournement depouvior (misapplication of power). It has exercised its jurisdiction liberally.Main characteristic features of droit administratif. The following characteristic features are of the Droit Administratif in France:-  Module – 1 27
1. Those matters concerning the State and administrative litigation falls within the jurisdiction of administrative courts and cannot be decided by the land of the ordinary courts.2. Those deciding matters concerning the State and administrative litigation, rules as developed by the administrative courts are applied.3. If there is any conflict of jurisdiction between ordinary courts and administrative court, it is decided by the tribunal des conflicts.4. Conseil d’Etat is the highest administrative court.Prof. Brown and Prof. J.P. Garner have attributed to a combination offollowing factors as responsible for its successi) The composition and functions of the Conseil d’Etat itself;ii) The flexibility of its case-law;iii) The simplicity of the remedies available before theadministrative courts;iv) The special procedure evolved by those courts; andv) The character of the substantive law, which they apply.Despite the obvious merits of the French administrative law system, Prof. Dicey was of the opinion that there was no rule of law in France nor was the system so satisfactory as it was in England. He believed that the review of administrative action is better administered in England than in France.The system of Droit Administratif according to Dicey, is based on the following two ordinary principles which are alien to English law—Firstly, that the government and every servant of the government possess, as representative of the nation, a whole body of special rights, privileges or prerogatives as against private citizens, and the extent of rights, privileges or considerations which fix the legal rights and duties of one citizen towards another. An individual in his dealings with the State does not, according to French law; stand on the same footing as that on which he stands in dealing with his neighbor.Secondly, that the government and its officials should be independent of and free from the jurisdiction of ordinary courts.It was on the basis of these two principles that Dicey observed that Droit Administratif is opposed to rule of law and, therefore, administrative law is alien to English system. But this conclusion of Dicey was misconceived. Droit Administratif, that is, administrative law was as much there in England as it was in France but with a difference that the French Droit Administratif was based on a system, which was unknown to English law. In his later days after examining the things closely, Dicey seems to have perceptibly modified his stand.Module – 1   28
Despite its overall superiority, the French administrative law cannot be characterized with perfection. Its glories have been marked by the persistent slowness in the judicial reviews at the administrative courts and by the difficulties of ensuring the execution of its last judgment. Moreover, judicial control is the only one method of controlling administrative action in French administrative law, whereas, in England, a vigilant public opinion, a watchful Parliament, a self-disciplined civil service and the jurisdiction of administrative process serve as the additional modes of control over administrative action. By contrast, it has to be conceded that the French system still excels its counterpart in the common law countries of the world.CLASSIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONAdministrative action is a comprehensive term and defies exact definition. In modern times the administrative process is a by-product of intensive form of government and cuts across the traditional classification of governmental powers and combines into one all the powers, which were traditionally exercised by three different organs of the State. Therefore, there is general agreement among the writers on administrative law that any attempt of classifying administrative functions or any conceptual basis is not only impossible but also futile. Even then a student of administrative law is compelled to delve into field of classification because the present-day law especially relating to judicial review freely employs conceptual classification of administrative action. Thus, speaking generally, an administrative action can be classified into four categories:i) Rule-making action or quasi-legislative action – Legislature is the law-making organ of any state. In some written constitutions, like the American and Australian Constitutions, the law making power is expressly vested in the legislature. However, in the Indian Constitution though this power is not so expressly vested in the legislature, yet the combined effect of Articles 107 to III and 196 to 201 is that the law making power can be exercised for the Union by Parliament and for the States by the respective State legislatures. It is the intention of the Constitution-makers that those bodies alone must exercise this law-making power in which this power is vested. But in the twentieth Century today these legislative bodies cannot give that quality and quantity of laws, which are required for the efficient functioning of a modern intensive form of government. Therefore, the  i) Rule-making action or quasi-legislative action.ii) Rule-decision action or quasi-judicial action.iii) Rule-application action or administrative action.iv) Ministerial actionModule – 1   29
delegation of law-making power to the administration is a compulsive necessity. When any administrative authority exercises the law-making power delegated to it by the legislature, it is known as the rule-making power delegated to it by the legislature, it is known as the rule-making action of the administration or quasi-legislative action and commonly known as delegated legislation.Rule-making action of the administration partakes all the characteristics, which a normal legislative action possesses. Such characteristics may be generality, prospectivity and a behaviour that bases action on policy consideration and gives a right or a disability. These characteristics are not without exception. In some cases, administrative rule-making action may be particularised, retroactive and based on evidence.(ii) Rule-decision action or quasi-judicial action – Today the bulk of the decisions which affect a private individual come not from courts but from administrative agencies exercising ad judicatory powers. The reason seems to be that since administrative decision-making is also a by-product of the intensive form of government, the traditional judicial system cannot give to the people that quantity of justice, which is required in a welfare State.Administrative decision-making may be defined, as a power to perform acts administrative in character, but requiring incidentally some characteristics of judicial traditions. On the basis of this definition, the following functions of the administration have been held to be quasi-judicial functions:1. 2.3. 4.5. 6. 7.8.9. 10.Disciplinary proceedings against students.Disciplinary proceedings against an employee for misconduct.Confiscation of goods under the sea Customs Act, 1878. Cancellation, suspension, revocation or refusal to renew license or permit by licensing authority.Determination of citizenship.Determination of statutory disputes.Power to continue the detention or seizure of goods beyond a particular period.Refusal to grant ‘no objection certificate’ under the Bombay Cinemas (Regulations) Act, 1953. Forfeiture of pensions and gratuity.Authority granting or refusing permission for retrenchment. Module – 130
11. Grant of permit by Regional Transport Authority. Attributes of administrative decision-making action or quasi-judicial action andthe distinction between judicial, quasi-judicial and administrative action.(iii) Rule-application action or administrative action – Though the distinction between quasi-judicial and administrative action has become blurred, yet it does not mean that there is no distinction between the two. If two persons are wearing a similar coat, it does not mean that there is no difference between them. The difference between quasi-judicial and administrative action may not be of much practical consequence today but it may still be relevant in determining the measure of natural justice applicable in a given situation.In A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India, the Court was of the view that in order to determine whether the action of the administrative authority is quasi-judicial or administrative, one has to see the nature of power conferred, to whom power is given, the framework within which power is conferred and the consequences.Therefore, administrative action is the residuary action which is neither legislative nor judicial. It is concerned with the treatment of a particular situation and is devoid of generality. It has no procedural obligations of collecting evidence and weighing argument. It is based on subjective satisfaction where decision is based on policy and expediency. It does not decide a right though it may affect a right. However, it does not mean that the principles of natural justice can be ignored completely when the authority is exercising “administrative powers”. Unless the statute provides otherwise, a minimum of the principles of natural justice must always be observed depending on the fact situation of each case.No exhaustive list of such actions may be drawn; however, a few may be noted for the sake of clarity:1) Making a reference to a tribunal for adjudication under the Industrial Disputes Act.2) Functions of a selection committee.Administrative action may be statutory, having the force of law, or non statutory, devoid of such legal force. The bulk of the administrative action is statutory because a statute or the Constitution gives it a legal force but in some cases it may be non-statutory, such as issuing directions to subordinates not having the force of law, but its violation may be visited with disciplinary action. Though by and large administrative action is discretionary and is based on subjective satisfaction, however, the administrative authority must act fairly, impartially and reasonable.Therefore, at this stage it becomes very important for us to know what exactly is the difference between Administrative and quasi-judicial Acts.Module – 1   31
Thus broadly speaking, acts, which are required to be done on the subjective satisfaction of the administrative authority, are called ‘administrative’ acts, while acts, which are required to be done on objective satisfaction of the administrative authority, can be termed as quasi-judicial acts. Administrative decisions, which are founded on pre-determined standards, are called objective decisions whereas decisions which involve a choice as there is no fixed standard to be applied are so called subjective decisions. The former is quasi-judicial decision while the latter is administrative decision. In case of the administrative decision there is no legal obligation upon the person charged with the duty of reaching the decision to consider and weigh, submissions and arguments or to collate any evidence. The grounds upon which he acts and the means, which he takes to inform himself before acting, are left entirely to his discretion. The Supreme Court observed, “It is well settled that the old distinction between a judicial act and administrative act has withered away and we have been liberated from the pestilent incantation of administrative action.1. 2.(iv)Ministerial action – A further distillate of administrative action is ministerial action. Ministerial action is that action of the administrative agency, which is taken as matter of duty imposed upon it by the law devoid of any discretion or judgment. Therefore, a ministerial action involves the performance of a definitive duty in respect of which there is no choice. Collection of revenue may be one such ministerial action.Notes and administrative instruction issued in the absence of anyIf administrative instructions are not referable to any statutory authority they cannot have the effect of taking away rights vested in the person governed by the Act.DELEGATED LEGISLATIONOne of the most significant developments of the present century is the growth in the legislative powers of the executives. The development of the legislative powers of the administrative authorities in the form of the delegated legislation occupies very important place in the study of the administrative law. We know that there is no such general power granted to the executive to make law it only supplements the law under the authority of legislature. This type of activity namely, the power to supplement legislation been described as delegated legislation or subordinate legislation.Why delegated legislation becomes inevitable The reasons as to why the Parliament alone cannot perform the jobs of legislation in this changed context are not far to seek. Apart from other considerations the inability of the Parliament to supply the necessary quantity and quality legislation to the society may be attributed to the following reasons : Module – 1 32
i)ii)iii)iv)iv)Certain emergency situations may arise which necessitate special measures. In such cases speedy and appropriate action is required. The Parliament cannot act quickly because of its political nature and because of the time required by the Parliament to enact the law.The bulk of the business of the Parliament has increased and it has no time for the consideration of complicated and technical matters. The Parliament cannot provide the society with the requisite quality and quantity of legislation because of lack of time. Most of the time of the Parliament is devoted to political matters, matters of policy and particularly foreign affairs..Certain matters covered by delegated legislation are of a technical nature which require handling by experts. In such cases it is inevitable that powers to deal with such matters is given to the appropriate administrative agencies to be exercised according to the requirements of the subject matter. "Parliaments" cannot obviously provide for such matters as the members are at best politicians and not experts in various spheres of life.Parliament while deciding upon a certain course of action cannot foresee the difficulties, which may be encountered in its execution. Accordingly various statutes contain a 'removal of difficulty clause' empowering the administration to remove such difficulties by exercising the powers of making rules and regulations. These clauses are always so worded that very wide powers are given to the administration.The practice of delegated legislation introduces flexibility in the law. The rules and regulations, if found to be defective, can be modified quickly. Experiments can be made and experience can be profitability utilized.However theunanimous. The practice of delegated legislation was considered a factor, which promoted centralization. Delegated Legislation was considered a danger to the liberties of the people and a devise to place despotic powers in few hands. It was said that delegated legislation preserved the outward show of representative institutions while placing arbitrary and irresponsible power in new hands. But the tide of delegated legislation was high and these protests remained futile.A very strong case was made out against the practice of Delegated Legislation by Lord Hewart who considered increased governmental interference in individual activity and considered this practice as usurpation of legislative power of the executive. He showed the dangers inherent in the practice and argued that wide powers of legislation entrusted to the executive lead to tyranny and absolute despotism. The criticism was soattitude of the jurists towards delegated legislation has not beenModule – 1   33
strong and the picture painted was so shocking that a high power committee to inquire into matter was appointed by the Lord Chancellor. This committee thoroughly inquired into the problem and to the conclusion that delegated legislation was valuable and indeed inevitable. The committee observed that with reasonable vigilance and proper precautions there was nothing to be feared from this practice.Nature and Scope of delegated legislation Delegated legislation means legislation by authorities other than the Legislature, the former acting on express delegated authority and power from the later.Delegation is considered to be a sound basis for administrative efficiency and it does not by itself amount to abdication of power if restored to within proper limits. The delegation should not, in any case, be unguided and uncontrolled. Parliament and State Legislatures cannot abdicate the legislative power in its essential aspects which is to be exercised by them. It is only a nonessential legislative function that can be delegated and the moot point always lies in the line of demarcation between the essential and nonessential legislative functions.The essential legislative functions consist in making a law. It is to the legislature to formulate the legislative policy and delegate the formulation of details in implementing that policy. Discretion as to the formulation of the legislative policy is prerogative and function the legislature and it cannot be delegated to the executive. Discretion to make notifications and alterations in an Act while extending it and to effect amendments or repeals in the existing laws is subject to the condition precedent that essential legislative functions cannot be delegated authority cannot be precisely defined and each case has to be considered in its setting.In order to avoid the dangers, the scope of delegation is strictly circumscribed by the Legislature by providing for adequate safeguards, controls and appeals against the executive orders and decisions.The power delegated to the Executive to modify any provisions of an Act by an order must be within the framework of the Act giving such power. The power to make such a modification no doubt, implies certain amount of discretion but it is a power to be exercised in aid of the legislative policy of the Act and cannoti) travel beyond it, orii) run counter to it, oriii) certainly change the essential features, the identity, structure orthe policy of the Act.Under the constitution of India, articles 245 and 246 provide that the legislative powers shall be discharged by the Parliament and State legislature. The delegation of legislative power was conceived to be inevitable and therefore it was not prohibited in the constitution. Further, Articles 13(3)(a) ofModule – 1   34
the Constitution of India lays down that law includes any ordinances, order by- law, rule regulation, notification, etc. Which if found inviolation of fundamental rights would be void. Besides, there are number of judicial pronouncements by the courts where they have justified delegated legislation. For e.g.In re Delhi Laws Act case, AIR 1961 Supreme Court 332; Vasantlal Magan Bhaiv. State of Bombay, air 1961 SC 4; S. Avtar Singh v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, AIR 1977 J&K 4.While commenting on indispensability of delegated legislation JusticeKrishna Iyer has rightly observed in the case of Arvinder Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR A1979 SC 321, that the complexities of modern administration are so bafflingly intricate and bristle with details, urgencies, difficulties and need for flexibility that our massive legislature may not get off to a start if they must directly and comprehensively handle legislative business in their plentitude, proliferation and particularization Delegation of some part of legislative power becomes a compulsive necessity for viability.A provision in a statute which gives an express power to the Executive to amend or repeal any existing law is described in England as Henry viii Clause because the King came to exercise power to repeal Parliamentary laws. The said clause has fallen into disuse in England, but in India some traces of it are found here and there, for example, Article 372 of the Constitution authorizes the president of India to adopt pro Constitutional laws, and if necessary, to make such adaptations and modifications, (whether by way of repeal or amendment) so as to bring them in accord with the provisions of the Constitution. The State Reorganization Act, 1956 and some other Acts similar thereto also contain such a provision. So long as the modification of a provision of statute by the Executive is innocuous and immaterial and does not effect any essential change in the matter.Types of delegation of legislative power in India There are various types of delegation of legislative power.1. Skeleton delegation In this type of delegation of legislative power, the enabling statutes set out broad principles and empowers the executive authority to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act.A typical example of this kind is the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948.2. Machinery type This is the most common type of delegation of legislative power, in which the Act is supplemented by machinery provisions, that is, the power is conferred on the concerned department of the Government to prescribe – i) ii)The kind of formsThe method of publication Module – 135
iii) The manner of making returns, and v) Such other administrative detailsIn the case of this normal type of delegated legislation, the limits of the delegated power are clearly defined in the enabling statute and they do not include such exceptional powers as the power to legislate on matters of principle or to impose taxation or to amend an act of legislature. The exceptional type covers cases where –i) the powers mentioned above are given , orii) the power given is so vast that its limits are almost impossible ofdefinition, oriii) while limits are imposed, the control of the courts is ousted.Such type of delegation is commonly known as the Henry VIII Clause.An outstanding example of this kind is Section 7 of the Delhi Laws Act of 1912 by which the Provincial Government was authorized to extend, with restrictions and modifications as it thought fit any enactment in force in any part of India to the Province of Delhi. This is the most extreme type of delegation, which was impugned in the Supreme Court in the Delhi Laws Act case. A.I.R. 1951 S.C.332. It was held that the delegation of this type was invalid if the administrative authorities materially interfered with the policy of the Act, by the powers of amendment or restriction but the delegation was valid if it did not effect any essential change in the body or the policy of the Act.That takes us to a term "bye-law" whether it can be declared ultra vires ? if so when ? Generally under local laws and regulations the term bye-law is used such asi) public bodies of municipal kindii) public bodies concerned with government, oriii) corporations, oriv) societies formed for commercial or other purposes.The bodies are empowered under the Act to frame bye-laws and regulations for carrying on their administration.There are five main grounds on which any bye-law may be struck down as ultra vires. They are :a)b) c)That is not made and published in the manner specified by the Act, which authorises the making thereof;That is repugnant of the laws of the land;That is repugnant to the Act under which it is framed; Module – 136
d) That it is uncertain ; ande) That it is unreasonable.Modes of control over delegated legislation The practice of conferring legislative powers upon administrative authorities though beneficial and necessary is also dangerous because of the possibility of abuse of powers and other attendant evils. There is consensus of opinion that proper precautions must be taken for ensuring proper exercise of such powers. Wider discretion is most likely to result in arbitrariness. The exercise of delegated legislative powers must be properly circumscribed and vigilantly scrutinized by the Court and Legislature is not by itself enough to ensure the advantage of the practice or to avoid the danger of its misuse. For the reason, there are certain other methods of control emerging in this field.The control of delegated legislation may be one or more of the following types: -1) Procedural;2) Parliamentary; and3) JudicialJudicial control can be divided into the following two classes: -i) Doctrine of ultra vires and vi) Use of prerogative writs.Procedural Control Over Delegated Legislation(A Prior consultation of interests likely to be affected by proposed delegated Legislation From the citizen's post of view the must beneficial safeguard against the dangers of the misuse of delegated Legislation is the development of a procedure to be followed by the delegates while formulating rules and regulations. In England as in America the Legislature while delegating powers abstains from laying down elaborate procedure to be followed by the delegates. But certain acts do however provide for the consultation of interested bodies. and sometimes of certain Advisory Committees which must be consulted before the formulation and application of rules and regulations. This method has largely been developed by the administration independent of statute or requirements. The object is to ensure the participation of affected interests so as to avoid various possible hardships. The method of consultation has the dual merits of providing as opportunity to the affected interests to present their own case and to enable the administration to have a first-hand idea of the problems and conditions of the field in which delegated legislation is being contemplated.(B) Prior publicity of proposed rules and regulations Another method is antecedent publicity of statutory rules to inform those likely to be affected by the proposed rules and regulations so as to enable them to make representation for consideration of the rule-making authority. The rules of Module – 1   37
Publication Act, 1893, S.I. provided for the use of this method. The Act provided that notice of proposed 'statutory rules' is given and the representations of suggestions by interested bodies be considered and acted upon if proper. But the Statutory Instruments Act, 1946 omitted this practice in spite of the omission, the Committee on Ministers Powers 1932, emphasized the advantages of such a practice.(c) Publication of Delegated Legislation - Adequate publicity of delegated legislation is absolutely necessary to ensure that law may be ascertained with reasonable certainty by the affected persons. Further the rules and regulations should not come as a surprise and should not consequently bring hardships which would naturally result from such practice. If the law is not known a person cannot regulate his affiars to avoid a conflict with them and to avoid losses. The importance of these laws is realised in all countries and legislative enactments provide for adequate publicity.(d) Parliamentary control in India over delegation In India, the question of control on rule-making power engaged the attention of the Parliament. Under the Rule of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the House of the People provision has been made for a Committee which is called 'Committee on Subordinate Legislation'.The First Committee was constituted on Ist December, 1953 fori) Examining the delegated legislation, andii) Pointing out whether it has-a) Exceeded or departed from the original intentions of theParliament, orb) Effected any basic changes.Originally, the committee consisted to 10 members of the House and its strength was later raise to 13 members. It is usually presided over by a member of the Opposition. The Committeei) ii)i) ii) iii)scrutinizes the statutory rules, orders. Bye-laws, etc. made by any-making authority, andreport to the House whether the delegated power is being properly exercised within the limits of the delegated authority, whether under the Constitution or an Act of Parliament.It further examines whetherThe Subordinate legislation is in accord with the general objects of the Constitution or the Act pursuant to which it is made;it contains matter which should more properly be dealt within an Act of Parliament;it contains imposition of any tax; Module – 138
iv) it, directly or indirectly, ousts the jurisdiction of the courts of law;v) it gives retrospective effect to any of the provisions in respect of which the Constitution or the Act does not expressly confer anysuch power;vi) It is constitutional and valid;vii) it involves expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India orthe Public Revenues;viii) its form or purpose requires any elucidation for nay reason;ix) it appears to make some unusual or unexpected use of thepowers conferred by the Constitution or the Act pursuant towhich it is made; andx) there appears to have been unjustifiable delay in its publicationon its laying before the Parliament.The Committee of the first House of the People submitted a number of reports and continues to do useful work. The Committee considered the question of bringing about uniformity in the provisions of the Acts delegating legislative powers. It made certain recommendations in its First report (March, 1954) which it later modified in its Third Report (May, 1955) after noting the existing divergent legislation in India. The following are the modified recommendations1. That, in future, the Acts containing provisions for making rules, etc., shall lay down that such rules shall be laid on the Table as soon as possible.2. That all these rules shall be laid on the Table for a uniform and total period of 30 days before the date of their final publication.But it is not deemed expedient to lay any rule on the Table before the date of publication; such rule may be laid as soon as possible after publication. An Explanatory Note should, however, accompany such rules at the time they are so laid, explaining why it was not deemed expedient to lay these rules on the Table of the House before they were published.3. On the recommendation of the Committee, the bills are generally accompanied with Memoranda of Delegated Legislation in which; -.i) full purpose and effect of the delegation of power to the subordinateauthorities,ii) the points which may be covered by the rules,iii) the particulars of the subordinate authorities or the persons who are toexercise the delegated power, andiv) the manner in which such power has to be exercised, are mentioned.They point out if the delegation is of normal type or unusual. Module – 1 39
The usefulness of the Committee lies more in ensuring that the standards of legislative rule-making are observed that in merely formulating such standards. It should effectively point out the cases of any unusual or unexpected use of legislative power by the Executive.Parliamentary control of delegated legislation is thus exercised byi) taking the opportunity of examining the provisions providing for delegation in a Bill, andii) getting them scrutinized by parliamentary committee of the Rules, Regulations, Bye-laws and orders,When the Bill is debated,----i) the issue of necessity of delegation, andii) the contents of the provisions providing for delegation, can betaken up.After delegation is sanctioned in an Act, the exercise of this power by the authority concerned should receive the attention of the House of the Parliament. Indeed, it is this later stage of parliamentary scrutiny of the delegated authority and the rules as framed in its exercise that is more important. In a formal sense, this is sought to be provided by making it necessary that the rules, etc., shall be laid on the Table of the House. The members are informed of such laying in the daily agenda of the House. The advantage of this procedure is that members of both the Houses have such chances as parliamentary procedure –i) the modification or the repeal of the enactment under which obnoxious rules and orders are made, orii) revoking rules and orders themselves.The matter may be discussed in the House during the debates or on special motions.The provisions for laying the rule, etc., are being made now practically in every Act which contains a rule making provision. Such provisions are enacted in the following form: -(1) The Government may by notification in the official Gazette, make rules for carrying out all or any of the purposes of this Act.(2) Every rule made under this section shall be laid, as soon as may be, after it is made, before each House of Parliament while it is in session for a total period of fourteen days which may be comprised in one session or in the successive session immediately following, both Houses agree in making any modification in the Rule or in the annulment of the rule. The rule thereafter have effect only in such modified form or shall stand annulled, as the case may be, so however that any such modification or annulment shallModule – 1   40
be without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under that rule."If the Parliamentary control is not effective it becomes necessary to provide for certain procedural safeguards, which go to make the delegated legislation ascertainable and accessible.Control of delegated legislation by procedure---- The following requirements are made necessary for the exercise of the delegated authority under different statutes so that procedural safeguards are ensured.i) The Doctrine of ultra vires---- The chief instrument in the hands of the judiciary to control delegated legislation is the "Doctrine of ultra vires."The doctrine of ultra vires may apply with regard to-i) procedural provision; andii) substantive provisions.i) Procedural defects The Acts of Parliament delegating legislative powers to other bodies or authorities often provide certain procedural requirements to be complied with by such authorities while making rules and regulations, etc. These formalities may consist of consultation with interested bodies, publication of draft rules and regulations, hearing of objections, considerations of representations etc. If these formal requirements are mandatory in nature and are disregarded by the said authorities then the rules etc. so made by these authorities would be invalidated by the Judiciary. In short subordinate legislation in contravention of mandatory procedural requirements would be invalidated by the court as being ultra vires the parent statute. Provision in the parent Statute for consulting the interested parties likely to be affected, may, in such cases, avoid all these inconveniences and the Railway authorities may not enact such rule after they consult these interests. A simple provision regarding consultation thus assumes importance. On the other hand, if the procedural requirements were merely of directory nature, then a disregard thereof would not affect the validity of subordinate legislation.The fact that procedural requirements have far reaching effects, may be made clear by just one example. Suppose the Railway authorities want to relieve pressure of work of unloading goods during daytime at a station amidst a big and brisk business center. The public wants a reduction in the traffic jams due to heavy traffic because of unloading. The traffic authorities and Railway authorities decide to tackle the problem effectively by making the rule that the unloading be done during late hours of night. The railway authorities make an order to this effect, without consulting interested bodies. Such rule might cause many hardships e.g. –i) The conditions of labour are such that unloading of goods during the night would adversely affect the profit margin as the workers would charge more if they work in night shifts. Module – 141
ii) It may not be without risk to carry money from one place to another during late hours of night. If safety measures are employed, that in addition to the element of a greater risk, expenses would increase, adversely affecting the margin of profits.iii) The banking facilities may not be available freely during night.iv) Additional staff may be necessary in various concerns for nightduty.v) This business are loading and unloading during night may causeinconvenience and disturbance in the locality.Now infect of these difficulties another alternative which appears to be desirable is better supervision of unloading and better regulation of traffic by posting more police officers and stricter enforcement of traffic laws.Provisions in the parent statute for consulting the interested parties likely to be affected may, in such cases, avoid all these inconveniences, and the Railway authorities may not act such a rule after they consult these interests. A simple provision regarding consultation thus assumes importance.The question of the effectiveness of the application of the doctrine of ultra vires, so far as procedure is concerned, would largely depend upon the words used in the particular statue. If the words are specific and clearly indicate the bodies to be consulted, then it would be possible to show noncompliance.But in case where the minister is vested with the discretion to consult these bodies which he considers to be representative of the interests likely to be affected or where he is to consult such bodies, if any, it is very difficult to prove noncompliance with the procedural requirements.(ii) Substantive Defects In case of delegated legislation, unlike and Act of the Parliament, the court can inquire into whether it is with in the limits laid down by the present statute. If a piece of delegated legislation were found to be beyond such limits, court would declare it to be ultra vires and hence invalid. (R.V.Minister of Health, (1943), 2 ALL ER591).The administrative authorities exercising legislative power under the authority of an Act of the Parliament must do so in accordance with the terms and objects of such statute. To find out whether administrative authorities have properly exercised the powers, the court have to construe the parent statute so as to find out the intention of the legislature. The existence and extent of the powers of administrative authorities is to be affixed in the light of the provisions of the parent Act.Mandatory or directory procedural provision The question whether particular procedural requirements are mandatory or directory must be examined with care. In case the statute provided for the effect of noncompliance of such requirements, then it is to be followed by the courts without difficulty. But uncertainty creeps in where the statute is silent on the point and decision is to be made by the judiciary. The courts is determining whether the provisions to this effect in a particular Statute are mandatory or directory are guided byModule – 1   42
various factors. They must take into consideration the whole scheme of legislation and particularly evaluate the position of such provisions in their relation with the object of legislation. The nature of the subject matter to be regulated, the object of legislation, and the provisions as placed in the body of the Act must all be considered carefully, so as to find out as to what was the intention of the legislature. Much would depend upon the terms and scheme of a particular legislation, and hence broad generalizations in this matter are out of place.Judicial control over delegated legislature Judicial control over delegated legislature can be exercised at the following two levels :-1) Delegation may be challenged as unconstitutional; or2) That the Statutory power has been improperly exercised.The delegation can be challenged in the courts of law as being unconstitutional, excessive or arbitrary.The scope of permissible delegation is fairly wide. Within the wide limits. Delegation is sustained it does not otherwise, infringe the provisions of the Constitution. The limitations imposed by the application of the rule of ultra vires are quite clear. If the Act of the Legislature under which power is delegated, is ultra vires, the power of the legislature in the delegation can never be good. No delegated legislation can be inconsistent with the provisions of the Fundamental Rights. If the Act violates any Fundamental Rights the rules, regulations and bye-laws framed there under cannot be better.Where the Act is good, still the rules and regulations may contravene any Fundamental Right and have to be struck down.The validity of the rules may be assailed as the stage in two ways :-i) That they run counter to the provisions of the Act; andii) That they have been made in excess of the authority delegatedby the Legislature.The method under these sub-heads for the application of the rule of ultra vires is described as the method of substantive ultra vires. Here the substance of rules and regulations is gone into and not the procedural requirements of the rule making that may be prescribed in the statute. The latter is looked into under the procedural ultra vires rule.Power of Parliament to repeal law Under the provision to clause (2) of Article 254, Parliament can enact at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislature of the State,Ordinarily, the Parliament would not have the power to repeal a law passed by the State Legislature even though it is a law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List. Section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1935 did not contain any such power. Art. 254 (2) of the Constitution of India is in substance a reproduction of section 107 of theModule – 1   43
1935 Act, the concluding portion whereof being incorporated in a proviso with further additions.Now, by the proviso to Art. 254 (2), the Indian Constitution has enlarged the powers of Parliament and, under that proviso, Parliament can do what the Central Legislature could not do under section 107 of the Government of India Act, and can enact a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing a law of the State when it relates to a matter mentioned in the concurrent List. Therefore the Parliament can, acting under the proviso to Art. 254 (2) repeal a State Law.While the proviso does confer on Parliament a power to repeal a law passed by the State Legislature, this power is subject to certain limitations. It is limited to enacting a law with respect to the same matter adding to, amending, varying or repealing a law so made by the State Legislature. The law referred to here is the law mentioned in the body of Art. 254 (2), It is a law made by the State Legislature with reference to a matter in the Concurrent List containing provisions repugnant to an earlier law made by Parliament and with the consent to an earlier law made by Parliament and with the consent of the President. It is only such a law that can be altered, amended, repealed under the proviso.The power of repeal conferred by the proviso can be exercised by Parliament alone and cannot be delegated to an executive authority.The repeal of a statute means that the repealed statute must be regarded as if it had never been on the statute book. It is wiped out from the statute book.In the case of Delhi Laws Act, 1951 S.C.R. 747, it was held that to repeal or abrogate an existing law is the exercise of an essential legislative power.Parliament, being supreme, can certainly make a law abrogating or repealing by implication provisions of any preexisting law and no exception can be taken on the ground of excessive delegation to the Act of the Parliament itself.(a) Limits of permissible delegation When a legislature is given plenary power to legislate on a particular subject, there must also be an implied power to make laws incidental to the exercise of such power. It is a fundamental principle of constitutional law that everything necessary to the exercise of a power is included in the grant of the power. A legislature cannot certainly strip itself of its essential functions and vest the same on an extraneous authority. The primary duty of law making has to be discharged by the legislature itself but delegation may be reported to as a subsidiary or ancillary measure. (Edward Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Ajmer, (1955) 1. S.C.R. 735)Mahajan C.J. in Hari Shankar Bagla v. State of Madya Pradesh, A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 555 : (1955) 1.S.C.R. 380 at p. 388 observed :"The Legislature cannot delegate its functions of laying down legislative policy in respect of a measure and its formulation as a rule of conduct. TheModule – 1   44
legislature must declare the policy of the law and the legal principles which are to control and given cases and must provide a standard to guide the officials of the body in power to execute the law".Therefore the extent to which delegation is permissible is well settled. The legislature cannot delegate its essential legislative policy and principle and must afford guidance for carrying out the said policy before it delegates its delegates its subsidiary powers in that behalf. (Vasant lal Maganbhai Sanjanwala v. State of Bombay, A.I.R. 1961 S.C. 4)The guidance may be sufficient if the nature of things to be done and the purpose for which it is to be done are clearly indicated. The case of Hari Shankar Bagla v. State of Madhya Pradesh, A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 465: (1955) 1 S.C.R. 380 is an instance of such legislation.The policy and purpose may be pointed out in the section conferring the powers and may even be indicated in the preamble or else where in the Act.(b) Excessive delegation as a ground for invalidity of statute In dealing with the challenge the vires of any State on the ground of Excessive delegation it is necessary to enquire whether - The impugned delegation involves the delegation of an essential legislative functions or power, and In Vasant lals case (A.I.R. 1961 S.C. 4). Subba Rao, J. observed as follows;"The constitution confers a power and imposes a duty on the legislature to make laws. The essential legislative function is the determination of the legislative policy and its formulation as a rule of conduct. Obviously it cannot abdicate its functions in favour of another.But, in view of the multifarious activities of a welfare State, it (the legislature) cannot presumably work out all the details to sit the varying aspects of complex situations. It must necessarily delegate the working out of details to the executive or any other agency. But there is a danger inherent in such a process of delegation. An overburdened legislature or one controlled by a powerful executive may unduly overstep the limits of delegation. It may-a) not lay down any policy at all;b) declare its policy in vague and general terms;c) not set down any standard for the guidance of the executive;d) confer and arbitrary power to the executive on change ormodified the policy laid down by it with out reserving for itself any control over subordinate legislation.The self-effacement of legislative power in favour of another agency either in whole or in part is beyond the permissible limits of delegation.It is for a Court to hold on a fair, generous and liberal construction of on impugned statute whether the legislature exceeded such limits. Module – 1 45

But the term ‘Discretion’ when qualified by the word ‘administrative’ has somewhat different overtones. ‘Discretion’ in this sense means choosing from amongst the various available alternatives but with reference to the rules of reason and justice and not according to personal whims. Such exercise is not to be arbitrary, vague and fanciful, but legal and regular.The problem of administrative discretion is complex. It is true that in any intensive form of government, the government cannot function without the exercise of some discretion by the officials. But it is equally true that absolute discretion is a ruthless master. Discretionary power by itself is not pure evil but gives much room for misuse. Therefore, remedy lies in tightening the procedure and not in abolishing the power itself.There is no set pattern of conferring discretion on an administrative officer. Modern drafting technique uses the words ‘adequate’, ‘advisable’, ‘appropriate’, ‘beneficial’, ‘reputable’, ‘safe’, ‘sufficient’, ‘wholesome’, ‘deem fit’, ‘prejudicial to safety and security’, ‘satisfaction’, belief’, ‘efficient’, ‘public purpose’, etc. or their opposites. It is true that with the exercise of discretion on a case-to-case basis, these vague generalizations are reduced into more specific moulds, yet the margin of oscillation is never eliminated. Therefore, the need for judicial correction of unreasonable exercise of administrative discretion cannot be overemphasized.Judicial Behavior and Administrative Discretion in India Module – 1 49
Though courts in India have developed a few effective parameters for the proper exercise of discretion, the conspectus of judicial behavior still remains halting, variegated and residual, and lacks the activism of the American courts. Judicial control mechanism of administrative discretion is exercised at two stages:(1) Control at stage of delegation of discretionThe court exercise control over delegation of discretionary powers to the administration by adjudicating upon the constitutionality of the law under which such powers are delegated with reference to the fundamental rights enunciated in Part III of the Indian Constitution. Therefore, if the law confers vague and wide discretionary power on any administrative authority, it may be declared ultra vires Article 14, Article 19 and other provisions of the Constitution.In certain situations, the statute though it does not give discretionary power to the administrative authority to take action, may give discretionary power to frame rules and regulations affecting the rights of citizens. The court can control the bestowal of such discretion on the ground of excessive delegation.(2) Control at the stage of the exercise of discretionIn India, unlike the USA, there is no Administrative Procedure Act providing for judicial review on the exercise of administrative discretion. Therefore, the power of judicial review arises from the constitutional configuration of courts. Courts in India have always held the view that judge-proof discretion is a negation of the rule of law. Therefore, they have developed various formulations to control the exercise of administrative discretion. These formulations may be conveniently grouped into two broad generalizations:i) That the authority is deemed not to have exercised its discretion at all :-Under this categorization, courts exercise judicial control over administrative discretion if the authority has either abdicated its power or has put fetters on its exercise or the jurisdictional facts are either non-existent or have been wrongly determined.     I) at the stage of delegation of discretion;II) at the stage of the exercise of discretion.     i) That the authority is deemed not to have exercised its discretion at all.ii) That the authority has not exercised its discretion properly.Module – 1   50
Purtabpore Company Ltd. V. Cane Commissioner of Bihar,(AIR 1970 SC 1896) is a notable case in point. In this case the Cane Commissioner who had the power to reserve sugarcane areas for the respective sugar factories, at the dictation of the Chief Minister excluded 99 villages from the area reserved by him in favor of the appellant-company. The court quashed the exercise of discretion by the Cane Commissioner on the ground that the abdicated his power by exercising it at the dictation of some other authority; therefore, it was deemed that the authority had not exercised its discretion at all. Thus the exercise of discretion or in compliance with instructions of some other person amounts to failure to exercise the discretion altogether. It is immaterial that the authority invested with the discretion itself sought the instructions.ii) That the authority has not exercised its discretion properly This is an all-embracing formulation developed by courts in India to control the exercise of discretion by the administrative authority. Improper exercise of discretion includes everything that English courts include in ‘unreasonable’ exercise of discretion and American courts include in ‘arbitrary and capricious’ exercise of discretion. Improper exercise of discretion includes such things as ‘taking irrelevant considerations into account’, ‘acting for improper purpose’, ‘asking wrong questions’, ‘acting in bad faith’, ‘neglecting to take into consideration relevant factors’ or ‘acting unreasonable’.S.R. Venkataraman v. Union of India,(1979 2SCC 491) the appellant, a Central Government officer, was prematurely retired from service in ‘public interest’ under Rule 56(j)(i) on attaining the age of 50 years. Her contention was that the government did not apply its mind to her service record and that in the facts and circumstances of the case the discretion vested under Rule 56(j)(I) was not exercised for furtherance of public interest and that the order was based on extraneous circumstances. The government conceded that there was nothing on record to justify the order. The Supreme Court, quashing the order of the government, held that if a discretionary power has been exercised for an unauthorized purpose, it is generally immaterial whether its repository was acting in good faith or bad faith. An administrative order based on a reason or facts that do not exist must be held to be infected with an abuse of power.R.D. Shetty v. International Airport Authority (1979 3SCC 459): It is heartening to see the law catching up with the vagaries of the State’s dealings in the exercise of its discretion. In this case the issue was the awarding of a contract for running a second-class hotelier's and it was clearly stipulated that the acceptance of the tender would rest with the Airport Director who would not bind himself to accept any tender and reserved to himself the right to reject all or any of the tenders received without assigning any reason. The highest of all. A writ petition was filed by a person who was himself neither a tenderer nor an hotelier was filed by a person who was himself neither a tenderer nor a hotelier. His grievance was that he was in the same position as the successful tenderer because if an essential condition could be ignored in the tenderer’s case why not in the petitioner’s? The Supreme Court acceptedModule – 1   51
the plea of locus stand in challenging the administrative action. Justice P.N. Bhagwati, who delivered the judgment of the Court, held:1)2)3) It is indeed unthinkable that in a democracy governed by the rule of law the executive government or any of its officers should possess arbitrary powers over the interests of an individual. Every action of the executive government must be informed with reason and should be free from arbitrariness. That is the very essence of the rule of law and its bare minimal requirement.4) The government cannot be permitted to say that it will give jobs or enter into contracts or issue quotas or licenses only in favor of those having gray hair or belonging to a particular political party or professing a particular religious faith. The government is still the government when it acts in the matter of granting largesse and it cannot act arbitrarily. It does not stand in the same position as a private individual.The exercise of discretion must not be arbitrary, fanciful and influenced by extraneous considerations. In matters of discretion the choice must be dictated by public interest and must not be unprincipled or unreasoned.It has been firmly established that the discretionary powers given to the governmental or quasi-government authorities must be hedged by policy, standards, procedural safeguards or guidelines, failing which the exercise of discretion and its delegation may be quashed by the courts. This principle has been reiterated in many cases.Thus within the area of administrative discretion the courts have tried to fly high the flag of Rule of Law which aims at the progressive diminution of arbitrariness in the exercise of public power.In India the administrative discretion, thus, may be reveiwed by the court on the following grounds.I. Abuse of Discretion. Exercise of discretion is an inseparable part of sound administration and, therefore, the State which is itself a creature of the Constitution, cannot shed its limitation at any time in any sphere of State activity.It is a well-settled rule of administrative law that an executive authority must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its actions to be judged and it must scrupulously observe those standards on pain of invalidation of an act in violation of them. Module – 1   52
Now a day, the administrative authorities are conferred wide discretionary powers. There is a great need of their control so that they may mot be misused. The discretionary power is required to be exercised according to law. When the mode of exercising a valid power is improper or unreasonable there is an abuse of power. In the following conditions the abuse of the discretionary power is inferred: -i)ii)Use for improper purpose: - The discretionary power is required to be used for the purpose for which it has been given. If it is given for one purpose and used for another purpose. It will amount to abuse of power.Malafide or Bad faith: - If the discretionary power is exercised by the authority with bad faith or dishonest intention, the action is quashed by the court. Malafide exercise of discretionary power is always bad and taken as abuse of discretion. Malafide (bad faith) may be taken to mean dishonest intention or corrupt motive. In relation to the exercise of statutory powers it may be said to comprise dishonesty (or fraud) and malice. A power is exercised fraudulently. If its repository intends to achieve an object other than that for which he believes the power to have been conferred. The intention may be to promote another public interest or private interest.Irrelevant consideration: - The decision of the administrative authority is declared void if it is not based on relevant and germane considerations. The considerations will be irrelevant if there is no reasonable connection between the facts and the grounds.Leaving out relevant considerations: - The administrative authority exercising the discretionary power is required to take into account all the relevant facts. If it leaves out relevant consideration, its action will be invalid.Mixed consideration: - Sometimes the discretionary power is exercised by the authority on both relevant and irrelevant grounds. In such condition the court will examine whether or not the exclusion of the irrelevant or non-existent considerations would have affected the ultimate decision. If the court is satisfied that the exclusion of the irrelevant considerations would have affected the decision, the order passed by the authority in the exercise of the discretionary power will be declared invalid but if the court is satisfied that the exclusion of the irrelevant considerations would not be declared invalid.Unreasonableness: - The Discretionary power is required to be exercised by the authority reasonably. If it is exercised unreasonably it will be declared invalid by the court. Everyiii)iv)v)vi) Module – 153
authority is required to exercise its powers reasonably. In a case Lord Wrenbury has observed that a person in whom invested a discretion must exercise his discretion upon reasonable grounds. Where a person is conferred discretionary power it should not be taken to mean that he has been empowered to do what he likes merely because he is minded to do so. He is required to do what he ought and the discretion does not empower him to do what he likes. He is required, by use of his reason, to ascertain and follow the course which reason directs. He is required to act reasonablyvii) Colourable Exercise of Power: - Where the discretionary power is exercised by the authority on which it has been conferred ostensibly for the purpose for which it has been given but in reality for some other purpose, It is taken as colourable exercise of the discretionary power and it is declared invalid.viii) Non-compliance with procedural requirements and principles of natural justice: - If the procedural requirement laid down in the statute is mandatory and it is not complied, the exercise of power will be bad. Whether the procedural requirement is mandatory or directory is decided by the court. Principles of natural justice are also required to be observed.ix) Exceeding jurisdiction: - The authority is required to exercise the power with in the limits or the statute. Consequently, if the authority exceeds this limit, its action will be held to be ultra vires and, therefore, void.II. Failure to exercise Discretion.In the following condition the authority is taken to have failed to exercise its discretion and its decision or action will be bad.i)ii)Non-application of mind: - Where an authority is given discretionary powers it is required to exercise it by applying its mind to the facts and circumstances of the case in hand. If he does not do so it will be deemed to have failed to exercise its discretion and its action or decision will be bad.Acting under Dictation: - Where the authority exercises its discretionary power under the instructions or dictation from superior authority. It is taken, as non-exercise of power by the authority and its decision or action is bad. In such condition the authority purports to act on its won but in substance the power is not exercised by it but by the other authority. The authority entrusted with the powers does not take action on its own judgement and does not apply its mind. For example in Commissioner of Police v. Gordhandas the Police Module – 154
Commissioner empowered to grant license for construction of cinema theatres granted the license but later cancelled it on the discretion of the Government. The cancellation order was declared bad as the Police Commissioner did not apply his mind and acted under the dictation of the Government.III) Imposing fetters on the exercise of discretionary powers: - If the authority imposes fetters on its discretion by announcing rules of policy to be applied by it rigidly to all cases coming before it for decision, its action or decision will be bad. The authority entrusted with the discretionary power is required to exercise it after considering the individual cases and if the authority imposes fetters on its discretion by adopting fixed rule of policy to be applied rigidly to all cases coming before it, it will be taken as failure to exercise discretion and its action or decision or order will be bad.Administrative Discretion and fundamental rightsNo law can clothe administrative discretion with a complete finality, for the courts always examine the ambit and even the mode of its exercise for the angle of its conformity with fundamental rights.The fundamental rights thus provide a basis to the judiciary in India to control administrative discretion to a large extent. There have been a number of cases in which a law, conferring discretionary powers, has been held violative of a fundamental right. The following discussion will illustrate the cases of judicial restraints on the exercise of discretion in India.Administrative Discretion and Article 14.Article14 prevents arbitrary discretion being vested in the executive. Equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. Right to equality affords protection not only against discretionary laws passed by legislature but also prevents arbitrary discretion being vested in the executive. Often executive or administrative officer or Government is given wide discretionary power.In a number of cases, the Statute has been challenged on the ground that it conferred on an administrative authority wide discretionary powers of selecting persons or objects discriminately and therefore, it violated Article 14. The Court in determining the question of validity of such statute will examine whether the statute has laid down any principle or policy for the guidance of the exercise of discretion by the Government in the matter of selection or classification. The Court will not tolerate the delegation of uncontrolled power in the hands of the Executive to such an extent as to enable it to discriminate.In State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali, AIR 1952 SC 75. It was held that in so far as the Act empowered the Government to have cases or class of offences tried by special courts, it violated Article 14 of the Constitution. The court further held the Act invalid as it laid down “no yardstick or measure for the groupingModule – 1   55
either of persons or of cases or of offences” so as to distinguish them from others outside the purview of the Act. Moreover, the necessity of “speedier trial” was held to be too vague, uncertain and indefinite criterion to form the basis of a valid and reasonable classification.Under Article 19Article 19 guarantees certain freedoms to the citizens of India, but they are not absolute. Reasonable restrictions can be imposed on these freedoms under the authority of law. They cannot be contended merely on executive action. The reasonableness of the restrictions is open to judicial review. These freedoms can also be afflicted by administrative discretion. Such cases can be examined below.A number of cases have come up involving the question of validity of law conferring discretion on the Executive to restrict the right under Article 19(1)(b) and (e). The State has conferred powers on the Executive to extern a person from a particular area in the interest of peace and safety in a number of statutes. In Dr. Ram Manohar v. State of Delhi, AIR 1950 SC 211., where the D.M. was empowered under East Punjab Safety Act, 1949, to make an order of externment from an area in case he was satisfied that such an order was necessary to prevent a person from acting in any way prejudicial to public peace and order, the Supreme Court upheld the law conferring such discretion on the execution on the grounds, inter alia, that the law in the instant case was of temporary nature and it gave a right to the externee to receive the grounds of his externment from the Executive.In Hari v. Deputy Commissioner of Police, AIR 1956 SC 559, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of section 57 of the Bombay Police Act authorizing any of the officers specified therein to extern convicted persons from the area of his jurisdiction if he had reasons to believe that they are likely to commit any offence similar to that of which they were convicted. This provisions of law, which apparently appears to be a violation of he residence was upheld by court mainly on the considerations that certain safeguards are available to the externee, i.e., the right of hearing and the right to file an appeal to the State Government against the order.In a large number of cases, the question as to how much discretion can be conferred on the Executive to control and regulate trade and business has been raised. The general principle laid down in that the power conferred on the Executive should not be arbitrary, and that it should not be left entirely to the discretion of any authority to do anything it likes without any check or control by any higher authority.” “Any law or order which confers arbitrary and uncontrolled power upon the Executive in the matter of the regulating trade or business is normally available in commodities control cannot but be held to be unreasonable.” and no provisions to ensure a proper execution of the power and to operate as a check against injustice resulting from its improper exercise. The Supreme Court in H.R. Banthis v. Union of India (1979 1 SCC 166) declared a licensing provision invalid as it conferred an uncontrolled andModule – 1   56
unguided power on the Executive. The Gold (Control) Act, 1968, provided for licensing of dealers in gold ornaments. The Administrator was empowered under the Act to grant or renew licenses having regard to the matters, inter alia, the number of dealers existing in a region, anticipated demand, suitability of the applicant and public interest. The Supreme Court held that all these factors were vague and unintelligible. The term ‘region’ was nowhere defined in the Act. The expression ‘anticipated demand was vague one. The expression ‘suitability of the applicant and ‘public interest’ did not contain any objective standards or norms.Where the Act provides some general principles to guide the exercise of the discretion and thus saves it from being arbitrary and unbridled, the court will uphold it, but where the Executive has been granted ‘unfettered power to interfere with the freedom of property or trade and business, the court will strike down such provision of law.Under Article 31(2):Article 31(2) of the Constitution provided for acquisition of private property by the Government under the authority of law. It laid down two conditions, subject to which the property could be requisitioned À1) that the law provided for an amount (after 25th Amendment) to be given to the persons affected, which was non-justiciable; and (2) that the property was to be acquired for a public purpose. In an early case, where the law vested the administrative officer with the power to acquire estates of food grains at any price, it was held to be void on the grounds, inter alia, that it failed to fix the amount of compensation or specify the principles, on which it could be determined. Since the matter was entirely left to the discretion of the officer concerned to fix any compensation it liked, it violated Article 31(2).The property under Article 31(2) could be acquisitioned for a public purpose only. The Executive could be made the sole judge to decide a public purpose. No doubt, the Government is in best position to judge as to whether a public purpose could be achieved by issuing an acquisition order, but it is a justiciable issue and the final decision is with the courts in this matter. In West Bengal Settlement Kanungo Co-operative Credit Society Ltd. V. Bela Bannerjee,(AIR 1954 SC 170) the provision that a Government’s declaration as to its necessity to acquire certain land for public purpose shall be conclusive evidence thereof was held to be void. The Supreme Court observed that as Article 31(2) made the existence of a public purpose a necessary condition of acquisition, it is, therefore, necessary that the existence of such a purpose as a fact must be established objectively and the provision relating to the conclusiveness of the declaration of then Government as to the nature of the purpose of the acquisition must be held unconstitutional.The Courts have, however, attempted to construe the term public purpose rather broadly; the judicial test adopted for the purpose being that whatever furthers the general interests of the community as opposed to the particular interests of the individual is a public purpose. The general tendency of theModule – 1   57
Legislature is to confer the power of acquisition on the Executive in an undefined way by using vague expressions such as “purposes of the State” or “purposes of the Union”, so as to give wider latitude to the courts to uphold it.Thus, we have seen in the above illustrations how the courts have used the mechanism of fundamental rights to control the administrative discretion. In fact fundamental rights are very potential instruments by which the Judiciary in India can go a long way in warding off the dangers of administrative discretion.Judicial Control of Administrative discretion – The broad principles on which the exercise of discretionary powers can be controlled, have now been judicially settled. These principles can be examined under two main heads:a) where the exercise of the discretion is in excess of the authority, i.e., ultra vires;b) where there is abuse of the discretion or improper exercise of the discretion.These two categories, however, are not mutually exclusive. In one sense the exercise of the discretion may be ultra vires, in other sense the same might have been exercised on irrelevant considerations. As regards the ultra vires exercise of administrative discretion, the following incidents are pre-eminent: -1) where an authority to whom discretion is committed does not exercise that discretion himself;2) where the authority concerned acts under the dictation of another body and disables itself from exercising a discretion in each individual case;3) where the authority concerned in exercise of the discretion, does something which it has been forbidden to do, or does an act which it has been authorized to do;4) where the condition precedent to the exercise of its discretion is non- existent, in which case the authority lacks the jurisdiction to act as all.Under the second category, i.e., abuse of discretionary power, the following instances may be considered: -1) 2)where the discretionary power has been exercised arbitrarily or capriciously;where the discretionary power is exercised for an improper purpose, i.e., for a purpose other than the purpose of carrying into effect in the best way the provisions of the Act; Module – 158
3) 4)5) 6) 7) 8)where the discretionary power is exercised inconsistent with the spirit and purpose of the statute;where the authority exercising the discretion acts on extraneous considerations, that is to say, takes into account any matters which should not have been taken into account;where the authority concerned refuses or neglects to take into account relevant matter or material considerations;where the authority imposes a condition patently unrelated to or inconsistent with the purpose or policy of the expectation statute;where in the exercise of the discretionary power, it acts mala where the authority concerned acts unreasonably.Legitimate expectation as ground of judicial reviewfide; Besides the above grounds on which the exercise of discretionary powers can be examined, a third major basis of judicial review of administrative action is legitimate expectation, which is developing sharply in recent times. The concept of legitimate expectation in administrative law has now, undoubtedly, gained sufficient importance. It is stated that the legitimate expectation is the latest recruit to a long list of concepts fashioned by the courts for the review of administrative action and this creation takes its place besides such principles as the rules of natural justice, unreasonableness, the fiduciary duty of local authorities and in future, perhaps, the unreasonableness, the proportionality.In Union of India v. Hindustan Development Corporations, (1993 3SCC 499) the court held that it only operates in public law field and provides locus standi for judicial review. Its denial is a ground for challenging the decision but denial can be justified by showing some overriding public interest. In the instant case, question arose regarding the validity of the dual policy of the government in the matter of contracts with private parties for supply of goods. There was no fixed procedure for fixation of price and allotment of quality to be supplied by the big and small suppliers. The government adopted a dual price policy, lower price for big suppliers and higher price for small suppliers in public interest and allotment of quantity by suitably adjusting the same so as to break the cartel. The court held that this does not involve denial of any legitimate expectation. The court observed: legitimate expectations may come in various forms and owe their existence to different kind of circumstances and it is not possible to give an exhaustive list in the context of vast and fast expansion of governmental activities. By and large they arise in cases of promotions, which are in normal course expected, though not guaranteed by way of statutory right, in cases of contracts, distribution of largess by the Government and in somewhat similar situations.Legitimate expectation gives the applicant sufficient locus standi for judicial review. The doctrine of legitimate expectation is to be confined mostly to rightModule – 1   59
of fair hearing before a decision, which results in negativing a promise, or withdrawing an undertaking is taken. The doctrine does not give scope to claim relief straightaway from the administrative authorities as no crystallized right as such is involved. The protection of such legitimate does not require the fulfillment of the expectation where an overriding public interest requires otherwise. A case of legitimate expectation would arise when a body by representation or by past practice aroused expectation, which it would be within its powers to fulfill. The protection is limited to that extent and a judicial review can be within those limits. A person, who bases his claim on the doctrine of legitimate expectation, in the first instance, must satisfy that there is foundation and thus he has locus standi to make such a claim. There are stronger reasons as to why the legitimate expectation should not be substantively protected than the reason as to why it should be protected. If a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or arbitrary, discriminatory unfair or biased, gross abuse of power or violation of principles of natural justice, the same can be questioned on the well known grounds attracting Article 14 but a claim based on mere legitimate expectation without any thing more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles. It can be one of the grounds to consider but the court must lift the veil and see whether the decision is violative of these principles warranting interference. It depends very much on the facts and the concept of legitimate expectation which is the latest recruit to a long list of concepts fashioned by the courts for the review of administrative action, must be restricted to the general legal limitations applicable and binding the manner of the future exercise of administrative power in a particular case. It follows that the concept of legitimate expectation is “ not the key which unlocks the treasury of natural justice and it ought not to unlock the gate which shuts, the court out of review on the merits”, particularly when the element of speculation and uncertainly is inherent in that very concept. The courts should restrain themselves and restrict such claims duly to the legal limitations.Further in Food Corporation of India v. M/s. Kamdhenu Cattle Seed Industries AIR 1993 SC 1601. The doctrine of legitimate expectation gets assimilated in the rule of law and operates in our legal system in this manner and this extent.The Court observed:“The mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen, in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct enforceable right, but failure to consider and give due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary, and this is how the requirement of due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of non-arbitrariness, a necessary concomitant of the rule of law. Every legitimate expectation is a relevant factor requiring due consideration in a fair decision-making process.”In Lala Sachinder Kumar v. Patna Regional Development Authority, (AIR 1994 PATNA 128) the court again applied the doctrine of legitimate expectation and held the order of allotment of residential plots issued by the PatnaModule – 1   60
Regional Development Authority as bad. In the instant case Regional Development Authority issued an advertisement inviting applications for the allotment of residential plots. In this process preference was given to the employees of the Patna Regional Development Authority with out considering the case of applicant petitioner, whereas Rules did not provide for any such preferential allotment. The court held that allotment in favour of employees is arbitrary. The applicant petitioner has legitimate expectations to be considered for allotment.ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALSThere are a large number of laws which charge the Executive with adjudicatory functions, and the authorities so charged are, in the strict scene, administrative tribunals. Administrative tribunals are agencies created by specific enactments. Administrative adjudication is term synonymously used with administrative decision- making. The decision-making or adjudicatory function is exercised in a variety of ways. However, the most popular mode of adjudication is through tribunals.The main characteristics of Administrative Tribunals are as follows:•  Administrative Tribunals is the creation of a statute.•  An Administrative Tribunals is vested in the judicial power of the State andthereby performance quasi-judicial functions as distinguished form pureadministrative functions.•  Administrative Tribunals is bound to act judicially and follow the principles ofnatural justice.•  It has some of the trapping of a court and are required to act openly, fairly andimpartially.•  An administrative Tribunal is not bound by the strict rules of procedure andevidence prescribed by the civil procedure court.Let us now study the evolution of the Administrative Tribunals with special reference to Central Administrative Tribunal, State and Joint Administrative Tribunals, their jurisdiction, powers and authority. The composition of the Tribunal and its functioning will also be dealt with.ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS – EVOLUTION  Module – 1 61
The growth of Administrative Tribunals both in developed and developing countries has been a significant phenomenon of the twentieth century. In India also, innumerable Tribunals have been set up from time to time both at the center and the states, covering various areas of activities like trade, industry, banking, taxation etc. The question of establishment of Administrative Tribunals to provide speedy and inexpensive relief to the government employees relating to grievances on recruitment and other conditions of service had been under the consideration of Government of India for a long time. Due to their heavy preoccupation, long pending and backlog of cases, costs involved and time factors, Judicial Courts could not offer the much- needed remedy to the government servants, in their disputes with the government. The dissatisfaction among the employees, irrespective of the class, category or group to which they belong, is the direct result of delay in their long pending cases or cases not attended properly. Hence, a need arose to set up an institution, which would, help in dispensing prompt relief to harassed employees who perceive a sense of injustice and lack of fair play in dealing with their service grievances. This would motivate the employees better and raise their morale, which in turn would increase their productivity.The Administrative Reforms Commission (1966-70) recommended the setting up of Civil Service Tribunals to function as the final appellate authority, in respect of government orders inflicting major penalties of dismissal, removal from service and reduction in rank. As early as 1969, a Committee under the chairmanship of J.C. Shah had recommended that having regard to the very number of pending writ petitions of the employees in regard to the service matters, an independent Tribunal should be set up to exclusively deal with the service matters.The Supreme Court in 1980, while disposing of a batch of writ petitions observed that the public servants ought not to be driven to or forced to dissipate their time and energy in the courtroom battles. The Civil Service Tribunals should be constituted which should be the final arbiter in resolving the controversies relating to conditions of service. The government also suggested that public servants might approach fact- finding Administrative Tribunals in the first instance in the interest of successful administration.The matter came up for discussion in other forums also and a consensus emerged that setting up of Civil Service Tribunals would be desirable and necessary, in public interest, to adjudicate the complaints and grievances of the government employees. The Constitution (through 42nd amendment Article 323-A).This Act empowered the Parliament to provide for adjudication or trial by Administrative Tribunals of disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment and constitutions of service of persons appointed to public service and posts in connection with the affairs of the union or of any state or local or other authority within the territory of India or under the control of the government or any corporation owned or controlled by the government.In pursuance of the provisions of Article 323-A of the Constitution, the Administrative Tribunals Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on 29th January 1985 and received the assent of the President of India on 27th February 1985. Module – 1 62
 STRUCTURE OF THE TRIBUNALSThe Administrative Tribunals Act 1985 provides for the establishment of one Central Administrative Tribunal and a State Administrative Tribunal for each State like Haryana Administrative Tribunal etc; and Joint Administrative Tribunal for two or more states. The Central Administrative Tribunal with its principal bench at Delhi and other benches at Allahabad, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras was established on Ist November 1985. The Act vested the Central Administrative Tribunal with jurisdiction, powers and authority of the adjudication of disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment and service matters pertaining to the members of the all India Services and also any other civil service of the Union or holding a civil post under the Union or a post connected with defense or in the defense services being a post filled by a civilian. Six more benches of the Tribunal were set up by June, 1986 at Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Patna, Cuttack, and Jabalpur. The fifteenth bench was set up in 1988 at Ernakulam.The Act provides for setting up of State Administrative Tribunals to decide the services cases of state government employees. There is a provision for setting up of Joint Administrative Tribunal for two or more states. On receipt of specific requests from the Government of Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhaya Pradesh and Tamil Naidu, Administrative Tribunals have been set up, to look into the service matters of concerned state government employees. A joint Tribunal is also to be set up for the state of Arunachal Pradesh to function jointly with Guwahati bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal.COMPOSITION OF THE TRIBUNALSEach Tribunal shall consist of Chairman, such number of Vice-Chairman and judicial and administrative members as the appropriate Government (either the Central Government or any particular State Government singly or jointly) may deem fit (vide Sec. 5.(1) Act No. 13 of 1985). A bench shall consist of one judicial member and one administrative member. The bench at New Delhi was designated the Principal Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal and for the State Administrative Tribunals.

Chairman of such Tribunal or Chairman, Vice-Chairman or other member of any other Tribunal.Other than the appointments mentioned above the Vice-Chairman or member of a Central or State Tribunal, and also the Chairman of a State Tribunal, cannot be made eligible for any other employment either under the Government of India or under the Government of a State.JURISDICTION, POWERS AND AUTHORITYChapter III of the Administrative Tribunal Act deals with the jurisdiction, powers and authority of the tribunals. Section 14(1) of the Act vests the Central Administrative Tribunal to exercise all the jurisdiction, powers and authority exercisable by all the courts except the Supreme Court of India under Article 136 of the Constitution.One of the main features of the Indian Constitution is judicial review. There is a hierarchy of courts for the enforcement of legal and constitutional rights. One can appeal against the decision of one court to another, like from District Court to the High Court and then finally to the Supreme Court, But there is no such hierarchy of Administrative Tribunals and regarding adjudication of service matters, one would have a remedy only before one of the Tribunals. This is in contrast to the French system of administrative courts, where there is a hierarchy of administrative courts and one can appeal from one administrative court to another. But in India, with regard to decisions of the Tribunals, one cannot appeal to an Appellate Tribunal. Though Supreme Court under Article 136, has jurisdiction over the decisions of the Tribunals, as a matter of right, no person can appeal to the Supreme Court. It is discretionary with the Supreme Court to grant or not to grant special leave to appeal.The Administrative Tribunals have the authority to issue writs. In disposing of the cases, the Tribunal observes the canons, principles and norms of ‘natural justice’. The Act provides that “a Tribunal shall not be bound by the procedure laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, but shall be guided by the principles of natural justice. The Tribunal shall have power to regulate its own procedure including the fixing of the place and times of its enquiry and deciding whether to sit in public of private”.A Tribunal has the same jurisdiction, powers and authority, as those exercised by the High Court, in respect of “Contempt of itself” that is, punish for contempt, and for the purpose, the provisions of the contempt of Courts Act 1971 have been made applicable. This helps the Tribunals in ensuring that they are taken seriously and their orders are not ignored.PROCEDURE FOR APPLICATION TO THE TRIBUNALSChapter IV of the Administrative Tribunals Act prescribes for application to the Tribunal. A person aggrieved by any order pertaining to any matter within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal may make an application to it for redressal of grievance. Such applications should be in the prescribed form and have to be accompanied by relevant documents and evidence and by such fee as may be prescribed by the Central Government but not exceeding one hundred rupees for filing the application. The Tribunal shall not ordinarily admit an application unless it is satisfied that the applicant has availed of all remedies available to him under the relevant service rules. This includes the making of any administrative appeal or representation. Since consideration of such appeals and representations involve delay, the applicant can make an application before the Tribunal, if a period of six months has expired afterModule – 1   65
the representation was made no order has been made. But an application to the Tribunal has to be made within one year from the date of final order or rejection of the application or appeal or where no final order of rejection has been made, within one year from the date of expiry of six months period. The Tribunal. May, however admit any application even after one year, if the applicant can satisfy the Tribunal that he/she had sufficient cause for not making the application within the normal stipulated time.Every application is decided by the Tribunal or examination of documents, written representation and at a times depending on the case, on hearing of oral arguments. The applicant may either appear in person or through a legal practitioner who will present the case before the Tribunal. The orders of the Tribunal are binding on both the parties and should be complied within the time prescribed in the order or within six months of the receipt of the order where no time limit has been indicated in the order. The parties can approach the Supreme Court against the orders of the Tribunal by way of appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution.The Administrative Tribunals are not bound by the procedure laid down in the code of Civil Procedure 1908. They are guided by the principles of natural justice. Since these principles are flexible, adjustable according to the situation, they help the Tribunals in molding their procedure keeping in view the circumstances of a situation.ADVANTAGES OF THE TRIBUNAL:•  Appropriate and effective justice.•  Flexibility•  Speedy•  Less expensiveLimitations of the Tribunals:•  The tribunal consists of members and heads that may not possess any background of law.•  Tribunals do not rely on uniform precedence and hence may lead to arbitrary and inconsistent decision.           the dawThe concept of natural justice is the backbone of law and justice. In the quest for justice the principles of natural justice have been utilized sinceNatural Justice Meaning and Developmentn of civilization. Principles of natural justice trace their ancestry to ancient civilization and centuries long past. Initially natural justice was conceived as a concomitant of universal natural law. Judges haveModule – 1   66
used natural justice as to imply the existence of moral principles of self evident and unarguable truth. To justify the adoption, or continued existence, of a rule of law on the ground of its conformity to natural justice in this sense conceals the extent to which a judge is making a subjective moral judgment and suggests on the contrary, an objective inevitability.Natural Justice used in this way is another name for natural law although devoid of at least some of the theological and philosophical overtones and implications of that concept. This essential similarity is clearly demonstrated by Lord Esher M.R’s definition of natural justice as, “ the natural sense of what right and wrong.” 1 ( Voinet v Barrett, (1885) 55, L.J. Q. B, 39, 41).Most of the thinkers of fifteenth to eighteenth century considered natural lawand justice as consisting of universal rules based on reason and thus wereimmutable and inviolable. The history of natural law is a tale of the search ofmankind for absolute justice and its failure. Again and again in the course ofthe last 2500 years the idea of natural law has appeared in some form or theother, as an expression for the search for an ideal higher than positive law. (W.G. Friedman, Legal Theory 95. 5th ed. 1967).Greek thinkers laid the basis for natural law. The Greek philosophers traditionally regarded law as closely to both justice and ethics.Roman society was highly developed commercial society and Natural law played a creative and constructive role, thereby jus civil, was adopted to meet new demands.Similarly in the middle Ages, the Christian legal philosophy, considered natural law founded on reasons and a reflection of eternal laws. In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the authority of church was challenged and natural law was based on reason and not divine force.The use of natural law ideas in the development of English law revolves around two problems: the idea of the supremacy of law, and, in particular, the struggle between common law judges and parliament for legislative supremacy on one hand, and the introduction of equitable considerations of “Justice between man and man” on the other. The first ended in a clear victory for parliamentary supremacy and the defeat of higher law ideas; the latter, after a long period of comparative stagnation, is again a factor of considerable influence in the development of the law.A number of cases are evidenced with the beginning of seventeenth century wherein a statute was declared void and not binding for not being inconformity with the principles of Natural Justice.The concept of natural justice can be traced from Biblical Garden of Eden, as also from Greek, Roman and other ancient cultures like Hindu. The Vedic Indians too were familiar with the natural theory of law. The practice of confining the expression natural justice to the procedural principles (that noModule – 1   67
one shall be judge in his own case and both sides must heard) is of comparatively recent origin and it was always present in one way or the other form. The expression was used in the past interchangeably with the expressions Natural Law, Natural enquiry, the laws of God, Sampan jus and other similar expressions. (H.H. Marshall, Natural Justice 5 (1959) London)Thus, the widespread recognition, in many civilizations and over centuries the principle of natural justice belong rather to the common consciousness of the mankind than to juridical science.CONCEPTUAL FORMULATIONA comprehensive definition of natural justice is yet to be evolved. However, it is possible to enumerate with some certainty the main principles constituting natural justice in modern times. English and Indian courts have frequentlyresorted to such alternatives to natural justice as “fair play in action”, (Ridge V. Baldwin, (1963) 2 all E.R. 66; Wisemen V. Borneman (1969), 3 all E.R. 215; Mohinder Singh Gill V. Chief Election Commissioner, A. I. R 1978 S.C. 851.) Common fairness, (R.V. Secretary of State for the Home Department, exp. Hose ball, (1977) 1 W.L..R 766, 784). or the fundamental principles of a fair trail.(Tameshwar V The Queen, (1957) A. C. 476-486; Maneka Gandhi V Union of India A. I. R 1978 S.C 597).In Spackman’s case, (Spackman V. Plumstead District Board of Works, (1885) 10 App case 229, 240). Earl of Selborne, L.C observed that no doubt in the absence of special provisions as to how the person who is to decide is to proceed, the law will imply no more than that the substantial requirements of justice shall not be violated. He is not the judge in the proper sense of the word but he must give the parties an opportunity of being heard before him and stating their case and their view. There would be no decision within the meaning of the statute, if there were anything of that sort done contrary to essence of justice.Emphasizing for observance of natural justice again is Lesson’s case, (Lesson V. General Council of Medical Education (1889) US Ch. D 366, 383. Brown C.J using the term ‘natural justice’ stressed that the statute imparts that substantial element of natural justice must be found to have been present at the enquiry. The accused person must have notice of what he is accused and must be given an opportunity of being heard.The courts took these procedural safeguards in the past among different words. Conveying meaning i.e. the eternal justice or natural justice. The list of the words is long which were as :   Substantial justice; The essence of justice; Fundamental justice; Universal justice and Rational justice etc. Module – 1 68
So the term natural justice has very impressive ancestry and has been retained all over the world with some modifications. The very basic thing, which emerges from it, is. Fairness in the administration of justice, more than any other legal principle is not susceptible to concise definition. It has a different meaning in different countries. History and tradition shape and distort it. To judge these divergent procedures according to a common standard of fairness is therefore no easy matter. What fair means will surely irritate governments and plague jurists. Fair hearing, some say it constitutes as fifth freedom supplementing freedom of speech and religion, freedom from want and fear. Robert Jackson, J., remains us that procedural fairness and regularity are of indispensable essence of liberty.The concept of natural justice is not fixed one but has been changing from time, keeping its spirit against tyranny and injustice. Despite the many appellations applied to it and the various meanings attributed to it, through the ages, one thing remains constant. It is by its very nature a barrier against dictatorial power and therefore has been and still is an attribute of an civilized community that aspires to preserve democratic freedom. ( Rene Dussault, “Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Quebec,” Can Bar Rev. 79 (1967). The concept of natural justice is flexible and has been interpreted in many ways to serve the ends of justice.Thus the doctrine of natural justice is the result of a natural evolution. So let us try to find out what does natural justice mean?• Process”.Co-relationship between Law and Natural Justice.     •  Natural Justice is rooted in the natural sense of what is right and wrong. It mandates the Adjudicator or the administrator, as the case may be, to observe procedural fairness and propriety in holding/conducting trail, inquiry or investigation or other types of proceedings or process.•  The object of Natural Justice is to secure Justice by ensuring procedural fairness. To put it negatively, it is to prevent miscarriage of Justice.     •  The term “Natural Justice” may be equated with “procedural fairness” or “fair play in action”.•  It is concerned with procedure and it seeks to ensure that the procedure is just, fair and reasonable.•  It may be regarded as counterpart of the American “Due Module – 1 69
(a) Law is the means, Justice is the end. Law may be substantive as well as procedural.(b) Natural Justice also aims at Justice. It, however, concerns itself only with the procedure. It seeks to secure justice by ensuring procedural fairness. It creates conditions for doing justice.(c) Natural justice humanizes the Law and invests the Law with fairness.(d) Natural Justice supplements the Law but can supplant the Law.(e) Natural Justice operates in areas not specifically covered by theenacted law. An omission in statute, likely to deprive a procedure of fairness, may be supplied by reading into the relevant provision the appropriate principle of Natural Justice.Applicability of the principles of Natural JusticeToJudicial, quasi-judicial and administrative proceedings.The natural justice principles in India are transmigration of common law to the sub-continent during the British rule. Before the commencement of constitution the courts in India insisted on fair hearing where punishments were awarded under the statutory provisions and they demanded fair hearing, even in statutory requirements. But the decision of the Privy Council in the Shanker Sarup’s (28 1.A 203 P.C) case, held an order of distribution under Section 295 CPC to be in the nature of administrative Act, though right of the individual was affected. Similar other cases dealing with the orders of the administrative officer were held administrative in character. Such decisions subjected the working of the common law principle of hearing and this tendency continued to shape the Indian law. The principle established in the above cases clearly shows that the principles of natural justice were confined to judicial proceedings.So Indian courts clung to the traditional distinction between judicial, quasi- judicial and administrative functions. The application of natural justice was for considerable time confined to the judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings. The meaning and connotations of term quasi-judicial has engaged judicial attention repeatedly to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and having the duty to act judicially is said to be exercising a quasi-judicial functions.The decision of the House of Lords in Ridge’s case and subsequent cases has influenced most of the development of law in this respect in India. The influence of Ridge’s case judgment has been of considerable and valuable importance “in deciding the scope of the application of principles of natural justice.”Module – 1   70
In state of Bina Pani’s case (AIR 1967 S.C. 1259) the Supreme Court has tried to abandon the traditional view of first holding an act judicial and then to observe the principles of natural justice and stated:“ It is true that the order is administrative in Character but even an administrative order must be made consistently with the rules of natural justice.”The dichotomy between administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings vis-à-vis the doctrine of natural justice was finally discarded as unsound by the court in Re-H (K) (infant) and Schmidt cases in England. This development in the law had its parallel in India in the form of Associated Cement Companies Ltd.’s case, where in the Supreme Court with approval referred to the decision in Ridge’s case and latter in the Bina Pani’s case.The decision of Supreme Court in A.K.Kripak’s case (AIR 1973 S.C. 150) is landmark in the application of principles of natural justice. In the instant case court held:“ the dividing line between an administrative power and a quasi-judicial power is quite thin and is being gradually obliterated.”The observations of Hegde,J are remarkable. The learned judge after examining various English and Indian cases has tried to remove all the clouds of doubt relating to application of natural justice. To his Lordship, the concept of rule of law would loose its vitality if the instrumentalities of the state are not charged with the duty of discharging their functions in a fair and just manner.In D.F.O South Kheri’s case, ( AIR 1973 S.C. 203) the court reiterated that law must now be taken to be settled, that even in administrative proceedings, which involve civil consequences, the doctrine of natural justice must be held to be applicable.In order to put the controversy at rest Bhagwati,J. in Maneka’s case emphasized that enquiries which were considered administrative at one time are now considered quasi-judicial in character. Arriving at a just decision is the aim of both administrative and quasi-judicial enquiries. If the purpose of the rules of natural justice is to prevent miscarriage of justice one fails to see why those rules should be made inapplicable to administrative enquiries. From the above discussion, so hear the other side is a rule of fairness. Fairness is a component of rule of law, which pervades the constitution. The dispensation of natural justice by statute will render any decision without observance of natural justice as unjust and hence is not acceptable.The Two Fundamental Principles of Natural Justice. Module – 1 71
There are two fundamental principles of Natural Justice. They are: Nemo Judex in Causa Sua:(a) Rule against bias(b) None should be a Judge in his own cause.(i)(ii) Audi Alter am Par tem(a) Hear the other side.(b) Hear both sides.(c) No person should be condemned unheard.Doctrine of Bias.One of the essential elements of judicial process is that administrative authority acting in a quasi- judicial manner should be impartial, fair and free from bias. Rules of judicial conduct, since early times, have laid down that the deciding Officer should be free from any prejudices. Where a person, who discharges a quasi-judicial function, has, by his conduct, shown that he is interested, or appears to be interested, that will disentitle him from acting in that capacity.In this connection the Supreme Court pointed out that one of the fundamentalprinciples of natural justice is that in case of quasi-judicial proceedings, theauthority, empowered to decide the dispute between opposing parties mustbe one without bias, by which is meant an operative prejudice, whetherconscious or unconscious towards one side or the other in the dispute. (Wade, Administrative Law, Page 311, (1982) de Smith. Judicial Review of Administrative Action 151 (1980)).No tribunal can be Judge in his own cause and any person, who sits in judgment over the rights of others, should be free from any kind of bias and must be able to bear an impartial and objective mind to the question in controversy.Bias and Mala fide. In case of mala fide, Courts insist on proof of mala fide while as in case of bias, proof of actual bias is not necessary. What is necessary is that there was “real likelihood” of bias and the test is that of a reasonable man. “ The reason underlying this rule”, according to prof. M.P. Jain, is that bias being a mental condition there are serious difficulties in the path of proving on a balance of probabilities that a person required to act judicially was in fact biased. Bias is the result of an attitude of mind leading to a predisposition towards an issue. Bias may arise unconsciously. It is not necessary to prove existence of bias in fact, what is necessary is to apply the test what will reasonable person think about the matter?         Module – 1   72
Further, justice should not only be done but seem to be done. Therefore, the existence of actual bias is irrelevant. What is relevant is the impression which a reasonable man has of the administration of justice.” (See M.P. Jain ‘ Evolving Indian administrative Law’, p. 78.)Rule of bias is only a principle of judicial conduct and is imposed strictly onthe exercise of the judicial or quasi- judicial authorities. In the matters of solediscretion of the authority or in the matters depending upon the subjectivesatisfaction of the authority concerned, the Court will not issue any order onthe ground of bias for quashing it. The search for mala fide intention andscrutinizing the honest intention of the administrative authorities have alwaysbeen subject-matter of judicial review by the English Courts. (See Griffith and Street “Principles of Administrative Law”, p. 20.)Bias and Prejudice. Of a slightly lesser type of evil is prejudice. It is nearer to bias and sometimes it is likely to be misunderstood for bias. Judicial pronouncements on this aspect have made the distinction clear. The compilation of the words and phrases, which have been judicially defined, made by the West Publishing Co., mentions; Bias and prejudice are not synonymous terms. Prejudice is defined by Webster as to prepossess unexamined opinion or opinions formed without due knowledge of the facts and circumstances attending to the question, to bias, the mind by hasty and incorrect notion, and to give it an unreasonable bent to one side or other of a cause. Bias is the leaning of the mind, inclination, prepossession, and propensity towards some persons or objects, not leaving the mind indifferent. Bias is a particular influential power, which sways the judgment, the inclination of mind towards a particular object and is not synonymous with prejudice. A man may not be prejudiced without being biased about another, but he may be biased without being prejudiced.Thus bias is usually of three types:   (1) (2) (3)Pecuniary bias;Personal bias; andBias as to subject matters.Pecuniary Bias. A series of consistent decisions in English Courts have laid down the rule that the pecuniary interest, howsoever small, will invalidate the proceedings. So great enthusiasm was there in the minds of the English Judges against the pecuniary interest that very small amount and negligible quantity of interest were considered to be a valid ground, for reversing the judgment of Lord Chancellor Cottenham by the Appellate Court in Dimes case.(1852, 3 hlr 759) In this case the appellant was engaged in prolonged litigations against the respondent company. Against a decree passed by the V. C. Dimes he appealed before the Lord Chancellor, who gave the decision against him. It later came to the knowledge of the appellant that Lord Chancellor had a share in the respondent company. In appeal, their Lordships of House of Lords held that through Lord Chancellor forgot to mention about the interest in the company by mere inadvertence, yet the interest was sufficient to invalidate the decision given by the Lord Chancellor.(1)Module – 1   73
Indian Courts also invariably followed the decision in Dimes’ case. The Privy Council made a reference to this famous case in the case of Vassilliadas.(AIR 1945 SC 38) .Thus a pecuniary interest, howsoever insufficient, will disqualify a person from acting as a Judge.(2) Personal Bias. Personal bias has always been matter of judicial interpretation. It can be claimed that no other type of bias came for judicial scrutiny as much as this type At least for a full century. With the growing interdependability of human relations, cases of personal bias favouring one or the other party, have grown tremendously. Personal bias can be of two types viz.(a) (b)Where the presiding officer has formed the opinion without finally completing the proceeding.Where he is interested in one of the parties either directly as a party or indirectly as being related to one of the parties. In fact, there are number of situations which may create a personal bias in the Judge’s mind against one party in dispute before him. He may be friend of the party, or hostility against one of the parties to a case. All these situations create bias either in favour of or against the party and will operate as a disqualification for a person to act as a Judge.The leading case on the point is Mineral Development Ltd. V. State of Bihar,(AIR 1960 SC 468) in this case, the petitioner company was owned by Raja Kamkshya Narain Singh, who was a lessee for 99 years of 3026 villagers, situated in Bihar, for purposes of exploiting mica from them. The Minister of Revenue acting under Bihar Mica Act cancelled his license. The owner of the company raja Kamalkshya Narain singh, had opposed the Minister in general election of 1952 and the Minister had filed a criminal case under section 500, Indian Penal Code, against him and the case was transferred to a Magistrate in Delhi. The act of cancellation by the Minister was held to be a quasi- judicial act. Since the personal rivalry between the owner of the petitioner’s company and the minister concerned was established, the cancellation order became vitiated in law.The other case on the point is Manek Lal v. Prem Chand (AIR 1957 S.C. 425) Here the respondent had filed a complaint of professional misconduct against Manek Lal who was an advocate of Rajasthan High Court. The chief Justice of the High Court appointed bar council tribunal to enquire into the alleged misconduct of the petitioner. The tribunal consisted of the Chairman who had earlier represented the respondent in a case. He was a senior advocate and was once the advocate-General of the State. The Supreme Court held the view that even though Chairman had no personal contact with his client and did not remember that he had appeared on his behalf in certain proceedings, and there was no real likelihood of bias, yet he was disqualified to conduct the inquiry. He was disqualified on the ground that justice not only be done but must appear to be done to the litigating public. Actual proof of prejudice was not necessary; reasonable ground for assuming theModule – 1   74
possibility of bias is sufficient. A Judge should be able to act judicially, objectively and without any bias. In such cases what the court should see is not whether bias has in fact affected the judgment, but whether a litigant could reasonably apprehend that a bias attributable to a member of the tribunal might have operated against him in the final decision of the tribunal.(3) Bias as to the Subject-matter. A judge may have a bias in the subject matter, which means that he is himself a party, or has some direct connection with the litigation, so as to, constitute a legal interest. “A legal interest means that the Judge is in such a position that bias must be assumed.” The smallest legal interest will disqualify the Judge.Thus for example, members of a legal or other body, who had taken part in promulgating an order or regulation cannot afterwards sit for adjudication of a matter arising out of such order because they become disqualified on the ground of bias. Subject to statutory exceptions persons who once decided a question should not take part in reviewing their own decision on appeal.To disqualify on the ground of bias there must be intimate and direct connection between adjudicator and the issues in disputeTo vitiate the decision on the ground of bias as for the subject matter there must be real likelihood of bias such bias has been classified by Jain and Jain into four categories:-(a) Partiality of connection with the issues;(b) Departmental or official bias;(c) Prior utterances and pre-judgement of Issues.(d) Acting under dictation.II Audi Alter am Par tem(Hear the other side) Rule of Fair HearingMeaning, Object and AmbitThe second principle of natural justice is audi alteram partem (hear the otherside) i.e. no one should condemned unheard. It requires that both sidesshould be heard before passing the order. This rule insists that beforepassing the order against any person the reasonable opportunity must begiven to him. This rule implies that a person against whom an order to hisprejudice is passed should be given information as to the charges against himand should be given opportunity to submit his explanation thereto. 4 (See also National Central Cooperative Bank v. Ajay Kumar, A.I.R. 1994 S.C. 39).   Module – 1 75
Ingredients of fair hearingHearing’ involves a number of stages. Such stages or ingredients of fair hearing are as follows:-1. Notice: Hearing starts with the notice by the authority concerned to the affected person. Consequently, notice may be taken as the starting point of hearing. Unless a person knows the case against him, he cannot defend himself. Therefore, before the proceedings start, the authority concerned is required to give to the affected person the notice of the case against him. The proceedings started without giving notice to the affected party, would violate the principles of natural justice. The notice is required to be served on the concerned person properly.However, the omission to serve notice would not be fatal if the notice has not been served on the concerned person on account of his own, fault. For example, in a case some students were guilty of gross violence against other students. The notice could not be served on them because they had absconded. The action of the authority was held to be valid as the notice could not be served on the students on account of their own fault.The notice must give sufficient time to the person concerned to prepare his case. Whether the person concerned has been allowed sufficient time or not depends upon the facts of each case. The notice must be adequate and reasonable.The notice is required to be clear and unambiguous. If it is ambiguous or vague, it will not be treated as reasonable or proper notice. If the notice does not specify the action proposed to be taken, it is taken as vague and therefore, not proper.2. Hearing: An important concept in Administrative law is that of natural justice or right to fair hearing. A very significant question of modern Administrative law is, where can a right to hearing be claimed by a person against whom administrative action is prepared to be taken?We know that right to hearing becomes an important safeguard against any abuse, or arbitrary or wrong use, of its powers by the administration in several ways. A large volume of present day case law revalues around the theme, wherein courts are called upon to decide whether or not, in a particular situation, failure on the part of the administration to give as hearing is fatal to the action taken. There is no readymade formula to judge this question and every case is to be considered on its own merits.The right to hearing can be claimed by the individual affected by the administrative action from 3 sources.  Module – 1 76
Firstly, the requirement of hearing may be spelt out of certain fundamental rights granted by constitution.Secondly, the statute under which an administrative action is being taken may itself expressly impose the requirements of hearing. Thus Art. 311 of constitution lays down that no civil servant shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action.According to the prevalent principles of judicial review of administrative action, courts have far greater control over administrative action involving a hearing ( or “fair hearing” to be sure) than they have otherwise. Thus, a more effective control-mechanism comes into force.Thirdly it has been reiterated over and over again that a quasi- judicial body must follow principles of natural justice. But this gives rise to another intricate question: what is quasi-judicial? Answer to this question is not easy as no “ quasi-judicial” from “ administrative”. A general test sometimes adopted for the purpose is that “ any person or body having legal authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and having the duty to act judicially” acts in a quasi-judicial manner. But it is not clearly defined as to what is meant by “acting judicially.” This proposition is vague in the extreme; it is even a tautology to say that the function is quasi- judicial if it is to be done judicially. How is one to ascertain whether an authority is required to act judicially or not? The statutes, it becomes a matter of implication or inference fro the courts to decide, after reading a statute, whether the concerned authority acting under it is to act judicially. In the absence of any such explicit indication in a statute, it becomes a matter of implication or inference for the courts to decide, after reading a statute, whether the concerned authority is to act judicially or not. The courts make the necessary inference from “the cumulative effect of the courts make the necessary inference from “the cumulative effect of the nature of the right affected, the manner of the disposal provided, the objective criteria to be adopted, the phraseology use, the nature of the power conferred, of the duty imposed on the authority and the other indication afforded by the statute. “This prime facie is too broad a generalization, which is hardly adequate or articulate to predicate the nature of a function or a body with any certainty. The personality of a judge could make a substantial difference in the end-result, for one judge may be more inclined to lean towards a quasi-judicial approach by the administration in a particular context than another judge.The extension of the right of hearing to the person affected by administrative process has been consummated by extension of the scope of quasi-judicial and natural justice as well as by discarding the distinction between “quasi-judicial’ and ‘administrative’ and invoking the concept of fairness in administrative action. Hearing has thus become theModule – 1   77
norm, rather than an exception, in administrative process at the present- day.Requirements of fair hearing: A hearing will be treated as fair hearing if the following conditions are fulfilled:-1. Adjudicating authority receives all the relevant material produced by the individualA hearing to be treated a fair hearing the adjudicating authority should provide the person-affected opportunity to produce all the relevant materials, which he wishes to produce. If the adjudicating authority does not allow the person affected to produce material evidence, the refusal will be violative of the rule of fair hearing. If the adjudicating authority refuses to hear a person who does not appear at the first hearing but appears subsequently during the course of hearing. It would be against the principle of natural justice.2. The adjudicating authority discloses the individual concerned evidence or material which it wishes to use against him.It is the general principle that all the evidence which the authority wishes to use against the party, should be placed before the party for his comment and rebuttal. If the evidence is used without disclosing it to the affected party, it will be against the rule of fair hearing.The extent and context and content of the information to be disclosed depend upon the facts of each case.Ordinarily the evidence is required to be taken in the presence of the party concerned. However, in some situations this rule is relaxed. For example, where it is found that it would be embarrassing to the witness to testify in the presence of the party concerned, the evidence of the witness may be taken in the absence of the party.3. The adjudicating authority provides the person concerned an opportunity to rebut the evidence or material which the said authority issues to use against himThe hearing to be fair the adjudicating authority is not required only to disclose the person concerned the evidence or material to be taken against him but also to provide an opportunity to rebut the evidence or material.Cross-examination: The important question is, does it include right of cross-examination of witnesses? Whether it includes the right to cross- examination or not depends upon the provisions of the statute under which the hearing is being held and the facts and circumstances of theModule – 1   78
each case. Where domestic enquiry is made by the employees, right of cross examination is regarded as an essential part of the natural justice. In the case disciplinary proceedings initiated by the Government against the civil servants, the right to cross examination is not taken orally and enquiry is only a fact finding one.Hira Nath Mishra v. Rajendra Medical College, ( A.I. R 1973 S.C. 1260) in this case some male students were charged of some indecent behaviour towards some girl students. The accused male students were not allowed to cross-examine the girl students. The refusal allow the accused male students to cross examine the girl students was upheld and was not treated as violation of natural justice because allowing them the right of cross examination would have been embarrassing for the girl students. The refusal was necessary for protecting the girl students from any harassment later on.Sometimes the identity of the witness is required to be kept confidential because the disclosure thereto may be dangerous to their person or property. In a case the externment order was served on a person by the Deputy Commissioner under the Bombay Police act. The said person was not allowed to cross-examine the witnesses. The refusal was not taken as violation of the natural justice because the witnesses would not like to give evidence openly against the persons of bad characters due to fear of violence to their person or property.Similarly in another case the business premises of a persons where searched and certain watched were confiscated by the authority under Sea Customs Act. The said person was not allowed to cross-examine the persons who gave information to the authority. There was no violation of the natural justice. The court held that the principles of natural justice do not require the authority to allow the person concerned the right to cross-examine the witnesses in the matters of seizure of goods under the Sea Customs Act. If the person concerned is allowed the right to cross- examine, it is not necessary to follow the procedure laid down in the Indian Evidence Act.Legal Representation: An important question is whether right to be heard includes right to legal representation? Ordinarily the representation through a lawyer in the administrative adjudication is not considered as an indispensable part of the fair hearing. However, in certain situations denial of the right to legal representation amounts to violation of natural justice. Thus where the case involves a question of law or matter which is complicated and technical or where the person is illiterate or expert evidence is on record or the prosecution is conducted by legally trained persons, the denial of legal representation will amount to violation of natural justice because in such conditions the party may not be able to meet the case effectively and therefore he must be given some protect ional assistance to make his right to be heard meaningful. Module – 1 79
 Institutional Decision(One who decides must hear)In ordinary judicial proceedings, the person who hears must decide. In the judicial proceedings, thus the decision is the decision of the specific authority. But in many of the administrative proceedings the decision is not of one man or one authority i.e. it is not the personal decision of any designated officer individually. It is treated as the decision of the concerned department. Such decision is called institutional decisions. In such decision often one person hears and another person decides. In such decision there may be division in the decision making process as one person may hear and another person may decide.In Gullapalli Nageswara Rao v. A. P. State Road Transport Corporation the Supreme Court the hearing by one person and decision by another person has been held to be against the rule of fair hearing.But the actually the Administrative practice continues to permit the hearing by one person and decision by another.Post Decisional HearingPost decisional hearing may be taken to mean hearing after the decision sometimes public interest demands immediate action and it is not found practicable to afford hearing before the decision or order. In such situation the Supreme Court insists on the hearing after the decision or order. In short, in situations where prior hearing is dispensed with on the ground of public interest or expediency or emergency the Supreme Court insists on the post decisional hearing.In Charan Lal Sadu V. Union of India the Supreme Court has held that where a statute does not in terms exclude the rule of predecisional hearing but contemplates a post decisional hearing amounting to a full review of the original order on merits it would be construed as excluding the rule of audi alteram partem at the pre-decisional stage. If the statute is silent with regard o the giving of a pre-decisional hearing, then the administrative action after the post decisional hearing will be valid.The opinion of Chief Justice P. N. Bhagwati with regard to the post decisional hearing is notable. In his foreword to Dr. I. P. Massey’s book Administrative Law, he has stated that the Supreme Court’s decisions in Mohinder Singh Gill V. E. C. (A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 851) and Maneka Gandhi V. Union of India ( A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 597) have been misunderstood. It is clear that if prior hearing is required to be given as part of the rule of naturalModule – 1   80
justice, failure to give it would indubitably invalidate the exercise of power and it cannot be read into the statute because to do so would be to defeat the object and purpose of the exercise of the power, that past decisional hearing is required to be given and if that is not done, the exercise of the power would be vitiated. (Management of M/S M.S. Nally Bharat Engineering Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar 1990 S.C.C. 48)In normal cases pre-decisional hearing is considered necessary, however in exceptional cases, the absence of the provision for predicisional hearing does not vitiate the action if there is a provision for post decisional hearing.Reasoned decision (Speaking Order)Meaning and ImportanceReasoned decision may be taken to mean a decision which contains reason in its support. When the adjudicators bodies give reasons in support of their decisions, the decisions are treated as reasoned decision. A decision, thus supported by reasons is called reasoned decision. It is also called speaking order. In such condition the order speaks for itself or it tells its own story.The reasoned decision introduces fairness in the administrative powers. It excludes or at least minimizes arbitrariness. •  •  • • The right to reasons is an indispensable part of sound judicial review. The giving of reasons is one of the fundamental of good administration.It has been asserted that a part of the principle of natural justice is that a party is entitled to know the reason for the decision apart from the decision itself.In another words, a party is entitled to know the reason, for the decision, be it judicial or quasi-judicial. This requirement to give reasons, however, is an approach quite new to administrative law, as the prevailing law is that the quasi-judicial bodies need not give reasons in support of their decisions, although in some cases, the court did insist upon making ‘ speaking orders’. But a change in the approach is being noticed since last few years and a growing emphasis is being laid on these bodies to give reasons for their decisions.The reasoned decision gives satisfaction to the person against whom the decision has been given. It will convince the person against whom the decision has been given that the decision is not arbitrary but genuine. It will enable the person againstModule – 1   81
whom the decision has been given to examine his right of appeal. If reasons are not stated, the affected party may not be able to exercise his right of appeal effectively.Thus, the giving of reasons in support of the decision is now considered one of the fundamentals of good administration.In Sunil Batra v. Delhi administration, the Supreme Court while interpreting section 56 of the prisons act, 1894, observed that there is an implied duty on the jail superintendent to give reasons for putting bar fetters on a prisoner to avoid invalidity of that provision under article 21 of the constitution. Thus the Supreme Court laid the foundation of a sound administrative process requiting the ad judicatory authorities to substantiate their order with reasons. The court has also shown a tendency to emphasize upon the fact that the administrative order should contain reasons when they decide matters affecting the right of parties.Natural, Justice and Indian Constitution:The principles of natural justice in the modern context describe certain rules of procedure. It supplies the omissions of formulated law. The principles of natural justice are implicit in Article 14 and 21.The principles of natural justice have come to be recognized as being a part of the guarantee contained in Article 14 of the Constitution because of the new and dynamic interpretation given by the Supreme Court to the concept of equality, which is the subject matter of that Article. Violation of a rule of natural justice results in arbitrariness, which is the same as discrimination. Where discrimination is the result of State action, it is violation of Article 14. Therefore, a violation of principle of natural justice by a state action is a violation of Article 14. Article 14, however, is not the sole repository of the principles of natural justice. The principles of natural justice apply not only to legislation and Sate action but also where any tribunal, authority or body of men not coming within the definition of “State” in article 12, is charged with the duty of deciding a matter. In such a case, the principles of natural justice require that it must decide such matter fairly and impartially.The constitution of India, while guaranteeing right to life and personal liberty in Article 21 in the same under “procedure established by law”, the expression procedure established by law was substituted by constituent Assembly for due process clause as embodies in American constitution Art. 21 of the constitution envisage.“No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.”  Module – 1 82
Thus the first attempt to incorporate the American principle (which includes principles of natural justice) in the Indian constitution was failed. Later in the A.K. Gopalan’s case, (AIR 1950 S.C 27) Supreme Court held that procedure established by law meant procedure prescribed by the statute. Obviously it implies that law enacted by the state need not be in conformity with the principles of natural justice. Law in Art. 21 meant statute law and nothing more. In case of a procedure prescribed by law it cannot be questioned on the ground that it violates principles of natural justice. There is no guarantee that it will not enact a law contrary to the principles of A learned author was prompted to observe that this position of Art.21of the Indian constitution was more of a statute justice land not natural justice.The interpretation of Art. 21 given in the Gopalan case in fact placed the liberty of the citizen at the mercy of the party in power. Natural justice supplies the procedural omissions of a formulated law.According to Jackson J.Gopalan’s decision dominated the Indian scene for twenty eight years till the decision of Supreme Court in the celebrated case of Monika Gandhi’s which revolution the application rules of natural justice in India. In the instant case, a writ petition was filed under Art. 32 challenging the impugned order interlaid amongst other grounds for being impugned for denial of opportunity of being heard prior the impoundment of passport. As per Maneka’s rationale, a procedure could no more be a mere enacted or state prescribed procedure as laid down in Gopalan’s but had to be fair, just and reasonable procedure. The most notable and innovative holding in Maneka was that the principle of reasonableness legally as well as philosophically is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness and pervades Art. 14 like a boarding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Art. 21 must stand the test of reasonableness in Art. 14.Bhagwatil J, for majority referring to audi alteram partem which mandates that no one shall be condemned unheard, remarked:“Natural justice is a great humanizing principle intended to invest law with fairness and to secure justice and ever the year it has grown into a widely pervasive rule affecting large areas of administrative action. Thus the soul of natural justice is fair play in action and that is why it has received the widest recognition throughout the democratic world. In the United States, the right to     “It might be preferable to live under Russian law applied by common law Procedures, rather then under the Common law enforced by Russian procedure.”Module – 1   83
an administrative bearing is regarded as essential requirement of fundamental fairness and in England too it has been held that fair play in action demands that before any prejudicial or adverse action is taken against a person he must be given an opportunity to be heard.”So the rules of natural justice were applicable to administrative proceedings positively. The learned judge emphasized that the Audi alteram rule is intended to inject justice into the law and it cannot be applied to defeat the ends of justice or to make the law lifeless, absurd, stultifying, self defeating or plainly contrary to the common sense of the situation.Further Bhagwai observed that it must not be forgotten that natural justice is pragmatically flexible and is amenable to capsulation under the pressure of circumstances. The core of it must however remain namely, that the person affected must have reasonable opportunity of being heard and the hearing must be a genuine and not an empty public relations exercise. This rule should be sufficiently flexible to suit the exigencies of myriad kinds of situations, which may arise. The learned judge insisted for post decisional hearing in situations was urgency demands prompt action which cannot wait for a formal hearing because than world defeat the very purpose of a action.Thus Maneka decision has resurrected American procedural due process in Art, 21 which was freed from the confines of Gopalan’safter about twenty eight years on ‘procedure’.In one more case of the Mohinder Singh Gill, deserves attention due to observation made by Krishna Iyer, J on the principles of natural justice. The judicial history of natural justice in England and India has been remarkably traced by Krishana Iyer, J in this case by observing that the natural justice in no mystic testament of judgment juristic, but the pragmatic yet principled, requirement of fair play in action as the norm of civilized justice- system and minimum of good government-crystallized clearly in our jurisprudence by catena of cases here and elsewhere. Further, Krishana Iyer observed in the instant cases:“The rules of natural justice are rooted in all legal systems, not any new theology and are manifested in the twin principles.... while natural justice is universally respected, the standards vary withy situations contracting into a brief, even post-decisional opportunity, or expanding into trial-type trappings...good administration demands fair play in action and this simple desideratum is the foundation of natural justice.The rules of natural justice are not rigid norms of unchanging contents. Eachof the two main rules embrace a number of sub rules, which may very in theirapplication according to the context. In the words of the Supreme Court, theextent and application of the doctrine of natural justice cannot be imprisonedwithin the straitjacket of rigid formula. 33 ( V.N. Shukla, The Constitution of India, 388 (- 1974).Module – 1   84
Following Exceptions to Natural JusticeThough the normal rule is that a person who is affected by administrative action is entitled to claim natural justice, that requirement may be excluded under certain exceptional circumstances.Statutory Exclusion: The principle of natural justice may be excluded by the statutory provision. Where the statute expressly provides for the observance of the principles of natural justice, the provision is treated as mandatory and the authority is bound by it. Where the statute is silent as to the observance of the principle of natural justice, such silence is taken to imply the observance thereto. However, the principles of natural justice are not incapable of exclusion. The statute may exclude them. When the statute. When the statute expressly or by necessary implication excludes the application of the principles of natural justice the courts do not ignore the statutory mandate. But one thing may be noted that in India, Parliament is not supreme and therefore statutory exclusion is not final. The statute must stand the test of constitutional provision. Even if there is not provision under the statute for observance of the principle of natural justice, courts may read the requirement of natural justice for sustaining the law as constitution.Emergency: In exceptional cases of urgency or emergency where prompt and preventive action is required the principle of natural justice need not be observed. Thus, the pre-decisional hearing may be excluded where the prompt action is required to be taken in the interest of the public safety or public morality, e.g., where a person who is dangerous to peace in the so morality e.g. Where a person who is dangerous to peace in the society is required to be detained or extended or where a building which is dangerous to the human lives is required to be demolished or a trade which is dangerous to the society is required to be prohibited, a prompt action is required to be taken in the interest of public and hearing before the action may delay the administrative action and thereby cause injury to the public interest and public safety. Thus in such situation dine social necessity requires exclusion of the pre-decisional hearing. However, the determination of the situation requiring the exclusion of the rules of natural justice by the administrative authorities is not final and the court may review such determination.In Swadeshi Cottoin Mills v. Union of India, the Supreme Court held that the word ‘immediate” in Section 18AA of the Industries Act does not imply that the rule of natural justice can be excluded.Public Interest. The requirement of notice and hearing may be excluded where prompt action is to be taken in the interest of public safety, or public health, and public morality. In case of pulling down property to extinguish fire, destruction of unwholesome food etc., action has to be taken without giving the opportunity of hearing. Module – 1   85
In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India the Supreme Court observed that a passport may be impounded in public interest without compliance with the principles of natural justice but as soon as the order impounding the passport has been made, an opportunity of post decisional hearing, remedial in aim, should be given to the person concerned. In the case the court has also been held that “ public interest” is a justiciable issue and the determination of administrative authority on it is not final.Interim disciplinary action: The rules of natural justice is not attracted in the case of interim disciplinary action. For example, the order of suspension of an employee pending an inquiry against him is not final but interim order and the application of the rules of natural justice is not attracted in the case of such order.In Abhay Kumar v. K. Srinivasan an order was passed by the college authority debarring the student from entering the premises of the college and sttending the class till the pendency of a criminal case against him for stabbing a student. The Court held that the order was interim and not final. It was preventive in nature. It was passed with the object to maintain peace in the campus. The rules of natural justice were not applicable in the case such order.Academic evolution: Where a student is removed from an educational institution on the grounds of unsatisfactory academic performance, the requirement of pre-decisional hearing is excluded. The Supreme Court has made it clear that if the competent academic authority assess the work of a student over period of time and thereafter declare his work unsatisfactory the rule of natural justice may be excluded. but this exclusion does not apply in the case of disciplinary matters.Impracticability: Where the authority deals with a large number of person it is not practicable to give all of them opportunity of being heard and therefore in such condition the court does not insist on the observance of the rules of natural justice. In R. Radhakrishna v. Osmania University, the entire M.B.A. entrance examination was cancelled on the ground of mass copying. The court held that it was not possible to give all the examinees the opportunity of being heard before the cancellation of the examination.EFFECT OF FAILURE OF NATURAL JUSTICEIn England, for sometimes now, a question of some complexity which has been cropping up before the courts time and again is: When an authority required observing Module – 1   86
natural justice in making an order fails to do so, should the order made by it be regarded as void or a voidable?Generally speaking, a voidable order means that the order was legally valid at its inception, and it remains valid until it is set aside or quashed by the courts, that is, it has legal effect up to the time it is quashed. On the other hand, a void order is no order at all from its inception; it is a nullity and void ab initio. The controversy between void and voidable is making the England administrative law rather complicated. Before we go further, it may be necessary to enter into a caveat at this place with respect to a void ab initio, the uncertainties of administrative law are such that in most cases a person affected by such an order cannot be sure whether the order is really valid or not until the court decided the matter. Therefore, the affected person cannot just ignore the order treating it as a nullity. He has to go to a Court for an authoritative determination as to the nature of the order is void.For example, an order challenged as a nullity for failure of natural justice gives rise to the following crucial question: Was the authority required to follow natural justice? As the discussion in the previous pages shows, there is quite a good deal of uncertainty on both these points.Meagerly, J., brings out this point clearlyNevertheless, conceptually, there is a lot of difference between a void and voidable order. The question arises in various contexts and has a number of ramifications. It has great practical value insofar as the courts have taken recourse to conceptualistic logic to answer a number of questions. For example, the following are some of the question which arises in regard to orders passed infringing natural justice and which the courts have sought to answer by reasoning based on differentiation between void and avoidable orders, though not always with entire satisfaction: can infringement of natural justice be waived by the person affected? Are they protected? What is the effect of privatize clauses on such orders? Are they protected? Can the defect of failure of natural justice be cured later by the same body or by a higher body? Can the court issue a writ (certiorari) to quash such an order without the affected person having taken recourse to the alternative remedy available under the statute in question? Can the person affected ignore such an order without incurring any liability, civil or criminal? Can the government seek to enforce an order challenged as void because of failure of natural justice pending the course decision on the matter? Who can challenge such an over? If the law prescribes a time limit within which the order may be challenged, can it be challenged after the period of limitation? Can an order the challenged in collateral proceedings or only in direct proceedings to set it aside? Usually, a violable order cannot be challenged in collateral proceedings. It has to be set aside by the court in separate proceedings for the purpose. Suppose, a person is prosecuted criminally for infringing an order. He cannot then plead that the order is avoidable. He can raise such a plea if the order is void. But, as de Smith points out the case-law on the point is far being coherent Certiorari and not a declarations regarded as a suitable remedy for setting aside a void able decision.In India, by and large, the Indian case law has been free from the void/voidable controversy and the judicial thinking has been that a quasi-judicial order made without following natural justice is void and nullity. Module – 1 87
The most significant case in the series is Nawabkhan v. Gujarat S. 56 of the Bombay Police Act, 1951 empowers the Police Commissioner to extern any undesirable person on certain grounds set out therein. An order passed by the commissioner on the petitioner was disobeyed by him and he was prosecuted fro this in a criminal court. During the pendency of his case, on a writ petition filed by the petitioner, the High Court quashed the internment order on the ground of failure of natural justice. The trial court then acquitted the appellant. The government appealed against the acquittal and the High Court convicted him for disobeying the order. The High Court took the position that the order in question was not void ab initio; the appellant had disobeyed the order much earlier than date it was infringed by him; the High Courts own decision invalidating the order I question was not retroactive and did not render it non-ext or a nullity from its inception but it was invalidate only from the date the court declared it to be so by its judgment. Thus, the arguments adopted by the high Court were consistent with the view that the order in question was void able and not void.However, the matter came in appeal before the Supreme Court, which approached the matter from a different angle. The order of internment affected a Fundamental Right) art. 19) Of the appellant in a manner which was not reasonable. The order was thus illegal and unconstitutional and hence void. The court ruled definitively that an order infringing a constitutionally guaranteed right made without hearing the party affected, where hearing was required, would be void ab initio and ineffectual to bind the parties from the very beginning and a person cannot be convicted non observance of such an order. “Where hearing is obligated by statute which affects the fundamental right of a citizen, the duty to give the hearing sound in constitutional requirement an failure to comply with such a duty is fatal. The appellant could not this be convicted for flouting the police commissioners order which encroached upon his Fundamental Right and had been made without due hearing and was thus void ab initio and so was never really inexistence.Nawabkhan raises some critical issues. A few general commons may, however, be made at this place Much for the confusion in Administrative Law India can be avoided if the rule is accepted that an order made ought to have been observed, is void ab intio. A person disobeys an administrative order at his own risk, for if he disobeys an order, and the court later holds it as not void, then he suffers the consequence, for whether an order is void or not can only be settled conclusively by a court order Accepting the void ness rule will make authorities take care in passing orders after fulfilling all the necessary formalities. It will also denude the courts of discretion whether to set aside an order or not in case of violation of natural justice. However, there may be some situations when illation of a void order may not be excusable, e.g. when a prisoner escapes from thereon thinning that the administrative order under which he has been detained is void.It is an area where no general principle can be held applicable to all the varying situations because what has to be reconciled here is public interest with private rights. In most of the cases i.e. staying the implementation of the order challenged until the court is able to decide the question on merits. Module – 1 88
 DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST PUBLIC SERVANTS: ITS SIGNIFICANCEIn every organization the conduct and discipline is very important. Every organization, public or private, has certain rules and regulations governing the conduct or behavior of its employees. A high moral standard of conduct among the public servants is of utmost necessity to set an example to the public at large. Integrity and discipline in the service are essential for an efficient personnel system. In order to prevent misuse of powers, a code of conduct to regulate the behaviour of the civil servants is enforced.With the transformation of passive police state into an active welfare state, drastic changes have been brought in the role of the state. Its administrative machinery influences every aspect of human life in numerous ways. Along with the ever- increasing responsibilities of powers of civil servants, administrative inefficiencies, such as red tapism, lethargy, corruption etc. crept into administration. Rapid growth in the numerical strength, continuos extension in the powers of civil servants, change in the concept of civil neutrality, shift from negative to positive work and increasing emphasis on moral and professional standards have become the modern trends of personnel administration and thus it gained momentum. If the public servants – the backbone of the government – are undermined by indiscipline and misconduct, it will lead to the collapse of administrative machinery.Constitutional Protection to Civil ServantsIn India government is the biggest provider of jobs to the people. According to an estimate in 1947 the strength of civil servants was 10 lakhs, which rose to 20 lakhs in 1978 and became 30 lakhs in 1993. However, this does not include the jobs in public sector undertakings. Maximum numbers of jobs provided by the government are in defense, railways and post offices.This tremendous growth in civil services was mainly due to the fact that without a big army of civil servants it was not possible to realize the dream of a Welfare State, which was the cornerstone of the Indian Constitution.India is the only country where law relating to service matters of the civil servants is provided in the constitution. Therefore Chapter XIV containing Articles from 308 to 323 providing protection to civil servants was included in the Constitution. However, Article 314 that provided protection to the members of Indian Civil Service was repealed by the Twenty-eight-Constitution Amendment Act, 1972 after the last member to the service retired.DISCIPLINARY ACTION – MEANINGDisciplinary action means the administrative steps taken to correct the misbehaviour of the employee in relation to the performance of his/her job. Corrective action is initiated to prevent the deterioration of his/her job. Corrective action is initiated to prevent the deterioration of individual inefficiency and to ensure that it does not spread to other employees.Module – 1   89
A distinction needs to be drawn between disciplinary action of civil or criminal procedure. The former deals with the fault committed in office violating, the internal regulations or rules of the administration while the latter is concerned with the violation of law to be dealt with by civil and criminal courts. The following matters are covered in the Conduct Rules. More strictness is observed in those services where more discretion is involved:i) Maintenance of correct behaviour official superiors,ii) Loyalty to the State.iii) Regulation of political activities to ensure neutrality of the personnel,iv) Enforcement of a certain code of ethics in the official, private and domesticlife.v) Protection of the integrity of the officials by placing restrictions oninvestments, borrowings, engaged in trade or business, acquisition or disposal of movable and immovable valuable property, acceptance of gifts and presents, andvi) Restriction on more than one marriage.CAUSES OF DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGSThe following are the various causes of disciplinary proceedings.1) Acts Amounting to Crimesa) Embezzlementb) Falsification of accounts not amounting to misappropriation of moneyc) Fraudulent claims (e.g. T.A.)d) Forgery of documentse) Theft of Government propertyf) Defrauding Governmentg) Briberyh) Corruptioni) Possession of disproportionate assetsj) Offences against other laws applicable to Government Servants.2) Conduct Amounting to Misdemeanora) b) c)Disobedience of orders Insubordination Misbehaviour Module – 190

Informal disciplinary action may mean assignment to a less desirable work, closer supervision, loss or withholding of privileges, failure of consultations in relevant matters, rejection of proposals or recommendation. It may includes curtailing of his/her authority and diminishing his/her responsibility The reason for taking informal disciplinary action may be that offences are too slight, or too subtle, or too difficult to prove, to warrant direct and formal action.Formal disciplinary action follows where the offence is serious and can be legally established. In such cases the penalties that are imposed on a member of the service are;1) Minor Penaltiesa) Censureb) Withholding of promotionsc) Recovery from pay of the whole or part of any loss caused toGovernment or to a company, association or body of individuals. Andd) Withholding of increments of pay.2) Major Penaltiesa)b) c)Reduction to a lower stage in the time scale of pay for a specified period.Reduction to a lower time scale of pay, grade or post, andCompulsory retirement. Module – 191
In very serious cases of offence, even judicial proceedings against the offender may also be launched.MODE OF TAKING DISCIPLINARY ACTIONUsually following provisions are made either in the Constitution or in the statute to check the misuse of power to take disciplinary actions :a) No employee shall be demoted or dismissed by an officer below in rank to one who had appointed him/her.b) No employee shall be punished except for a cause, specified in some statute or departmental regulation.c) No employee shall be punished unless he / she has been given reasonable opportunity to defend his / her case.d) The employee shall be informed of the charges laid against him / her.e) Where a board of Inquiry is appointed, it shall consist of not less than two senior officers, provided that at least one member of such board shall be anofficer of the service to which the employee belongs.f) After the inquiry against an employee has been completed and after thepunishing authority has arrived at any provisional conclusion in regard to the penalty to be imposed, if the penalty proposed is dismissal, removal, reduction in rank or compulsory retirement, the employee charged shall be supplied with a copy of the report of inquiry and be given a further opportunity to show cause why the proposed penalty should not be imposed on him / her.CONSTITUTION OF INDIA – DEALING WITH DISCIPLINARY MATTERSArticle 309 provides that the Acts of the appropriate legislature may regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of the persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State. It shall be competent for the President or Governor as the case may be, to make rules regulating and recruitment and conditions of service of public service until provisions are made by an Act of the appropriate legislature.According to Article 310, every person who is a member of a defence service or the civil service of the Union or an All India Service or holds any post connected with defense or any civil post under the union holds office during the pleasure of the president, and every person who is a member of a civil service of a state or holds a civil post under a state holds office during the pleasure of the Governor of the State. Notwithstanding that a person holding a civil post under the Union or a State holds office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor of the State, any contract under which a person, (not being a member of a defence service or of an All India Service or of a civil service of the Union or a State) is appointed under theModule – 1   92
Constitution to hold such a post may, if the President or the Governor deems it necessary in order to secure the services of persons having special qualifications, provide for the payment to him of compensation, if before the expiration of an agreed period that post is abolished or he is required to vacate that post.Article 311as amended by Forty-second. Amendment provides that no person who is a member of a civil post under the union or a state, shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he / she was appointed. No such person is aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank except after an enquiry in which he / she has been informed of the charges against him / her given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of those charges. Where it is proposed after such enquiry to impose upon him / her any such penalty, such penalty may be imposed on the basis of the evidence provided during such inquiry and it shall not be necessary to give such person any opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed. This clause shall not apply where a person is dismissed or removed or reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has led to his / her conviction on a criminal charge or where the authority empowered to dismiss or remove a person or to reduce him / her in rank is satisfied that for some reason to hold such enquiry. Or where the President of the Governor, as the case may be, is satisfied that in the interests of the security of the State, it is not expedient to hold such enquiry. If in respect of any such person as aforesaid, a question arises, whether it is reasonably practicable to hold the enquiry mentioned above, the decision thereon of the authority empowered the dismiss or remove such person or reduce him / her in rank shall be final.SUCCESSIVE STEPS INVOLVED IN DISPLINARY PROCEEDINGSThe successive steps of the procedure of disciplinary action are:i) Calling for an explanation from the employee to be subjected to disciplinary action.ii) If the explanation is not forthcoming or is unsatisfactory, framing of charges;iii) Suspension of the employee if his / her remaining in the service is likely to prejudice the evidence against him / her.iv) Hearing of the charges, and giving opportunity to the employee to defend himself / herself;v) Findings and report;vi) Giving another opportunity to the employee to defend himself/herselfagainst the purposed punishment.vii) Punishment order, or exoneration; andviii) Appeal, if any.   Module – 1   93
ISSUES AND PROBLEMSThere are various problems concerning the disciplinary proceedings. They are as follows:i) Lack of knowledge of the Disciplinary ProcedureIt has been seen many a time that the appointing authorities as well as employees are unaware of the details of the disciplinary procedures resulting in many problems.ii) DelaysThe time taken to take disciplinary action is very long. When an employee knows of the impending action, he / she becomes more and more irresponsible and problematic. Delays cause hardship to the employees.iii) Lack of fair PlayThere is a tendency that the appellate authority generally supports the decision of his / her subordinates. This defeats the purpose of appeal.iv) Withholding of AppealMost of the officers do not like appeals against their decisions. There is a tendency to withhold appeals.v) InconsistencyDisciplinary action should be consistent under the same offence. Otherwise it leads to favoritism, nepotism and corruption. Module – 1 94

 Judicial Control of Administrative ActionIt is a admitted fact that the administrative authorities now a days are conferred on wide administrative powers which are required to be controlled otherwise they will become new despots. The Administrative Law aims to find out the ways and means to control the powers of the administrative authorities.In the context of increased powers for the administration, judicial control has become an important area of administrative law, because Courts have proved more effective and useful than the Legislature or the administration in the matter. “It is an accepted axiom” observed Prof. Jain & Jain that “the real kernel of democracy lies in the Courts enjoying the ultimate authority to restrain all exercise of absolute and arbitrary power. Without some kind of judicial power to control the administrative authorities, there is a danger that they may commit excess and degenerate into arbitrary authorities, and such a development would be inimical to a democratic Constitution and the concept of rule of law. “Judicial Control (Judicial Remedies).Judiciary has been given wide powers for controlling the administrative action. The Courts have been given power to review the acts of the legislature and executive (administration) and declare them void in case they are found in violation of the provisions of the Constitution.In India the modes of judicial control of administrative action can be conveniently grouped into three heads:JUDICIAL REVIEW & ITS EXCLUSION (A) Constitutional;(B) Statutory;(C) Ordinary or Equitable. Module – 197
Judicial review, in short, is the authority of the Courts to declare void the acts of the legislature and executive, if they are found in the violation of the provisions of the Constitution. Judicial Review is the power of the highest Court of a jurisdiction to invalidate on Constitutional grounds, the acts of other Government agency within that jurisdiction.The doctrine of judicial review has been originated and developed by the American Supreme Court, although there is no express provision in the American Constitution for the judicial review. In Marbury v. Madison the Supreme Court made it clear that it had the power of judicial review.In England there is supremacy of Parliament and therefore, the Act passed or the law made by Parliament cannot be declared to be void by the Court. The function of the judiciary is to ensure that the administration or executive function conforms to the law.The Constitution of India expressly provides for judicial review. Like U.S.A., there is supremacy of the Constitution of India. Consequently, an Act passed by the legislature is required to be in conformity with the requirements of the Constitution and it is for the judiciary to decide whether or not the Act is in conformity with the Constitutional requirements and if it is found in violation of the Constitutional provisions the Court has to declare it unconstitutional and therefore, void because the Court is bound by its oath to uphold the Constitution.The Constitution of India, unlike the American Constitution expressly provides for the judicial review. The limits laid down by the Constitution may be express or implied. Articles 13, 245 and 246, etc. provide the express limits of the Constitution.The provisions of Article 13 are:Article 13 (1) provides that all laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of the Constitution of India, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provision of Part III dealing with the fundamental rights shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void. Article 13 (2) provides the State Shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the fundamental rights and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.Article 245 makes it clear that the legislative powers of Parliament and of the State Legislatures are subject to the provisions of the Constitution. Parliament may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the legislature of State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State. No law made by Parliament shall be deemed to be invalid on the ground that it would have been extra-territorial operation. The State Legislature can make law only for the State concerned and, therefore, the law made by the state Legislature having operation outside the State would be beyond its competence and, therefore ultra vires and void. Module – 1 98
The doctrine of ultra vires has been proved very effective in controlling the delegation of legislative function by the legislature and for making it more effective it is required to be applied more rigorously. Sometimes the Court’s attitude is found to be very liberal.Supreme Court has held that the legislature delegating the legislative power must lay down the legislative policy and guideline regarding the exercise of essential legislative function, which consists of the determination of legislative policy and its formulation as a rule of conduct. Delegation without laying down the legislative policy or standard for the guidance of the delegate will amount to abdication of essential legislative function by the Legislature. The delegation of essential legislative function falls in the category of excessive delegation and such delegation is not permissible.The power of judicial review controls not only the legislative but also the executive or administrative act. The Court scrutinizes the executive act for determining the issue as to whether it is within the scope of the authority or power conferred on the authority exercising the power. For this purpose the ultra vires rules provides much assistance in the Court. Where the act of the executive or administration is found ultra virus the Constitution or the relevant Act, it is declared ultra virus and, therefore, void. The Courts attitude appears to be stiffer in respect of the discretionary power of the executive or administrative authorities. The Court is not against the vesting of the discretionary power in the executive, but it expects that there would be proper guidelines or normal for the exercise of the power. The Court interferes when the uncontrolled and unguided discretion is vested in the executive or administrative authorities or the repository of the power abuses its discretionary power.The judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the manner in which the decision has been made. The judicial review is concerned not with the decision but with the decision making process.The Supreme Court has expressed the view that in the exercise of the power of judicial review the Court should observe the self-restraint and confine itself the question of legality. Its concern should be:1. Whether a decision making authority exceeding its power?2. Committed an error of law.3. Committed a breach of the rules of natural justice.4. Reached a decision which no reasonable tribunal would havereached, or5. Abused its power.It is not for the Court to determine whether a particular policy or a particular decision taken in the furtherance of the policy is fair. The Court is only concerned with the manner in which those decisions have been taken. TheModule – 1   99
extents of the duty to act fairly vary from case to case. The aforesaid grounds may be classified as under:(i) Illegality(ii) Irrationality(iii) Procedural impropriety.Mala fide exercise of power is taken as abuse of power : Mala fides may be taken to mean dishonest intension or corrupt motive. In relation to the exercise of statutory power it may be said to comprise dishonesty (or fraud) and malice. A power is exercised fraudulently. If its repository intends to achieve an object other than that for which he believes the power to have been conferred. The intention may be to promote another public interest or private interest. The burden to prove mala fide is on the person who wants the order to be quashed on the ground of mala fide.The judicial review is the supervisory jurisdiction.It is concerned not with the merit of a decision but with the manner in which the decision was made. The court will see that the decision making body acts fairly. It will ensure that the body acts in accordance with the law. Whenever its act is found unreasonable and arbitrary it is declared ultra vires and, therefore, void. In exercising the discretionary power the principles laid down in article 14 of the Constitution have to be kept in view. The power must be only be tested by the application of Waynesburg’s principle of reasonableness but must be free from arbitrariness not affected by bias or actuated by mala fides.The administrative action is subject to judicial review on the ground of procedural impropriety also. If the procedural requirement laid down in the statute is mandatory and it is not complied, the exercise of power will be bad. Whether the procedural requirement is mandatory or the Court decides directory. Principles of natural justice also need to be observed. If the order passed by the authority in the exercise of its power affected any person adversely. It is required to observe the principles of natural justice. In case of violation of the principles of natural justice, the order will be held to be void. The principles of natural justice are treated as part of the constitutional guarantee contained by Article 14 and their violation is taken as the violation of Article 14.Key points on judicial review•  The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Articles 32 and 136 and of High Court under Articles 226 and 227 have been proved of tremendous importance in the preservation and enforcement of the rule of law in India. Any statute cannot exclude the jurisdiction under these Articles.Module – 1   100
• • • • • In several cases, the Supreme Court has observed that the jurisdiction under Articles 32, 136, 226 and 227 cannot be excluded even where the action of the administration is made final by the Constitutional amendment.Judicial review is an unavoidable necessity wherever there is a constant danger of legislative or executive lapses and appealing erosion of ethical standards in the society.The judicial review is the basic feature of the Constitution, which has been entrusted to the Constitutional Courts, namely, the Supreme Court of India and High Courts under Article 32 and Articles 226 and 227 respectively. It is the Constitutional duty and responsibility of the Constitutional Courts as assigned under the Constitution, to maintain the balance of power between the Legislature, the Execution, and the judiciary.The judicial review is life-breath of constitutionalism. Judicial review passes upon constitutionality of legislative Acts or administrative actions. The Court either would enforce valid Acts/actions or refuse to enforce them when found unconstitutional.Judicial review does not concern itself with the merits of the Act or action but of the manner in which it has been done and its effect on constitutionalism. It, thereby, creates harmony between fundamental laws namely, the Constitution and the executive action or legislative Act.The Supreme Court of India has played significant role in the Constitutional development. The Scope of judicial review in India is sufficient to make the Supreme Court a powerful agency to control the activities of both the legislature and the executive.In Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain, ( A.I.R. 1975 S.C. 2299) the Supreme Court has held that even where the Constitution itself provides that the action of the administrative authority shall be final. The judicial review provided under Articles 32, 136, 226 and 227 is not barred. Judicial review is the part of the basic structure of the Constitution.Exclusion of Judicial Review (Ouster clause or finality clause)Finality clause may be taken to mean a section in the statute, which bars the jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts. The modern legislative tendency is to insert such clause to preclude the Courts from reviewing the law. On account of such tendency the danger of infringing the rights of the individuals is increasing. The rule of law requires that the aggrieved person should have right to approach the court for relief and, therefore, Courts do not appear to have accepted the Court or ouster clause in its face value and have evolvedModule – 1   101
several rules to waive such clauses for providing justice to the aggrieved person.Extent of Judicial Exclusion.The jurisdiction of the Courts is excluded in several ways. Exclusive may be express or implied.For example S.2 of the Foreigners act, 1946 may be mentioned as an example of express exclusion. It provides that the action taken under the act shall not be called in question in any legal proceeding before any Court of law.In India the position on the finality clause is not well settled. It is extremely complex issue. For this purpose the judicial review may be divided into two categories-The judicial review available under article 32, 136 226 and 227 is taken as Constitutional mode of judicial review, 1.e. the judicial review available under Articles 32, 136, 226, 227 cannot be excluded by the finality clause contained in the statute and expressed in any languages. Any statute or ordinary laws cannot take the jurisdiction of the Court under article 32, 136, 226 and 227 as the Constitution of India provides them. Thus, any ordinary law cannot bar the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 32 and 136 and of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227.In Keshava Nanda Bharti v. State of Kerala, ( A.I.R. 1973 S.C. 1461) the Supreme Court has held the Parliament has power to amend the Constitution but it cannot destroy or abrogate the basic structure or framework of the Constitution. Article 368 does not enable Parliament of abrogate or take away Fundamental right or to completely alter the fundamental features of the Constitution so as to destroy its identity. Judicial review therefore it cannot be taken away.In Indra Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain, the validity of Clause (4) of Article 329 – A inserted by the Constitution (39 the Amendment ) Act, 1975 was challenged on the ground that it destroyed the basic structure of the Constitution. The said Clause (4) provided that notwithstanding any Court order declaring the election of the Prime Minister or the Speaker of Parliament to be void, it would continue to be void in all respects and any such order and any finding on which such order was based would be deemed always to have been void and of no effect. This clause empowered Parliament to establish by law some Constitutional modes of judicial review and Non-Constitutional modes of judicial review.Module – 1   102
authority or body for deciding the dispute relating to the election of the Prime Minister or Speaker. It provides that the decision of such authority or body could not be challenged before the Court. This clause was declared unconstitutional and void as being violation of free and fair election, democracy and rule of law, which are parts of the basic structure of the Constitution. In case judicial review, democracy, free and fair election and rule of law were included in the list of the basic features of the Constitution. Consequently any Constitutional amendment, which takes away, any of them will be unconstitutional and therefore void.The non-constitutional mode of judicial review is conferred on the civil Courts by statute and therefore it may be barred or excluded by the statute. S. 9 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 confers a general jurisdiction to Civil Courts to entertain suits except where its jurisdiction is expressly or impliedly excluded.Implied exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts is usually given effect where the statute containing the exclusion clause is a self contained Code and provides remedy for the aggrieved person or for the settlement of the disputes.When not excluded.However, it is to be noted that the exclusion clause or ouster clause or finality clause does not exclude the jurisdiction of the Court in the condition Stated below:1. Unconstitutionality of the statute : Exclusion clause does not bar the jurisdiction of the Court to try a suit questioning the constitutionality of an action taken there under. If the statute, which contains the exclusion clause, is itself unconstitutional, the bar will not operate. The finality should not be taken to mean that unconstitutional or void laws be enforced without remedy.2. Ultra vires Administrative action : The exclusion clause does not bar the jurisdiction of the Court in case where the action of the authority is ultra vires. If action is ultra vires the powers of the administrative authority; the exclusion clause does not bar the jurisdiction of the Courts. The rule is applied not only in the case of substantive ultra vires but also in the case of procedural ultra vires. If the authority acts beyond its power or jurisdiction or violates the mandatory procedure prescribed by the statute, the exclusion or finality clause will not be taken as final and such a clause does not bar the jurisdiction of the Court.3. Jurisdictional error : The exclusion or ouster or finality clause does not bar the jurisdiction of the Court in case the administrative action is challenged on the ground of the jurisdictional error or lack of jurisdiction. The lack of jurisdiction or jurisdictional error may arise where the authority assumes jurisdiction, which never belongs to it or has exceeded its jurisdiction indicating the matter or has misused or abused its jurisdiction. The lack ofModule – 1   103
jurisdiction also arises where the authority exercising the jurisdiction is not properly constituted.4. Non compliance with the provisions of the statute : the exclusion clause will not bar the jurisdiction of the Court if the statutory provisions are not complied with. Thus if the provisions of the statute are not complied with, the Court will have jurisdiction inspite of the exclusion or finality clause.5. Violation of the Principles of natural Justice : If the order passed by the authority is challenged on the ground of violation of the principles of natural justice; the ouster clause or exclusion clause in the statute cannot prevent the Court from reviewing the order6. When finality clause relates to the question of fact and not of law :Where the finality clause makes the finding of a Tribunal final on question of facts, the decision of the Tribunal may be reviewed by the Court on the question of law.(A)The judicial control of administrative action provides a fundamental safeguard against the abuse of power. Since our Constitution was built upon the deep foundations of rule of law, the framers of the Constitution made sincere efforts to incorporate certain Articles in the Constitution to enable the courts to exercise effective control over administrative action. Let us discuss those articles of the constitution: -(a) Under article 32, the Supreme Court has been empowered to enforce fundamental rights guaranteed under Chapter III of the Constitution.Article 32 of the Constitution provides remedies by way of writs in this country. The Supreme Court has, under Article 32(2) power to issue appropriate directions, or orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, certiorari, mandamus, prohibition and quo- warranto The court can issue not only a writ but can also make any order or give any direction, which it may consider appropriate in the circumstances. It cannot turn down the petition simply on the ground that the proper writ or direction has not been prayed for.(b) Under article 226 concurrent powers have been conferred on the respective High Courts for the enforcement of fundamental rights or any other legal rights. It empowers every High Court to issue to any person or authority including any Government, in relation to which it exercises jurisdictions, directions, orders or writs including writs of habeas corpus,. mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari.    CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES  Module – 1 104
In a writ petition, High Court cannot go into the merits of the controversy. For example, in matters of retaining or pulling down a building the decision is not to be taken by the court as to whether or not it requires to be pulled down and a new building erected in its place.(c) Under Article 136 the Supreme Court has been further empowered, in its discretion, to grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order by any Court or tribunal in India. Article 136 conferred extraordinary powers on the Supreme Court to review all such administrative decisions, which are taken by the administrative authority in quasi-judicial capacity.The right to move the Supreme Court in itself is a guaranteed right, and Gajendragadkar, J., has assessed the significance of this in the following manner:“The fundamental right to move this Court can therefore be appropriately described as the cornerstone of the democratic edifice raised by the Constitution. That is why it is natural that this Court should in the words of Patanjali Sastri, J., regard itself as the protector and guarantor of fundamental rights and should declare that it cannot consistently with the responsibility laid upon it, refuse to entertain applications seeking protection against infringement of such rights.Since Article 32 is itself fundamental right, it cannot be whittled down by a legislation. It can be invoked even where an administrative action has been declared as final by the statute.An order made by a quasi-judicial authority having jurisdiction under an Act which is intra virus is not liable to be questioned on the sole ground that the provisions of the Act on the terms of the notification issued there under have been misinterpreted.The rule of maintainability of petition under Article 32 held above is subject to three exceptions.First, if the statute for a provision thereof ultra vires any action taken there under by a quasi-judicial authority which infringes or threatens to infringe a fundamental right, will give rise to the question of enforcement of that right and petition under Article 32 will lie.Second, if a quasi-judicial authority acts without jurisdiction or wrongly assumes jurisdiction by committing error as to a right, the question of enforcement of that arises and a petition under Article 32 will lie even if the statute is intra vires.Third, if the action taken by a quasi-judicial authority is procedurally ultra virus, a petition under Article 32 would be competent. Module – 1 105
Under Article 32 of the Constitution the following person may complain of the infraction of any fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution:Any person including corporate bodies who complains of the infraction of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution is at liberty to move the Supreme Court except where the languages of the provision or the nature of the right implies the inference that they are applicable only to natural person.The right that could be enforced under article 32 must ordinarily be the rights of the petitioner himself who complains of the infraction of such rights and approaches the Court for relief. An exception is as held in the Calcutta Gas Case,( AIR 1962 SC 1044) that in case of habeas corpus not only the man who is or detained in confinement but any person provided he is not an absolute stranger, can institute proceeding to obtain a writ of habeas corpus for the purpose of liberation.The Constitution of India assigns to the Supreme Court and the High Courts the role of the custodian and guarantor of fundamental rights. Therefore, where a fundamental right is involved, the courts consider it to be their duty to provide relief and remedy to the aggrieved person. In matters other than the fundamental rights, generally the jurisdiction of the courts to grant relief is considered to be discretionary. The discretion is, however, governed by the broad and fundamental principles, which apply to the writs in England.A petition under Art 32 may be rejected on the ground of inordinate delay However, a writ petition made after 12 years by a person belonging to lower echelons of service against the Department which and not counted his service in the officiating capacity, was entertained because the Department had not given reply to his representations.It was held in one of the decided case ( A.I.R 1964 S.C. 1013; Supreme Court Employees Welfare Association verses union of India A.I.R 1990 334) that a petition under Art 32 would be barred by res judicata if a petition on the same cause of action filed before the High Court was earlier rejected.The Court went further and said that the principle of res judicata did not apply to successive writ petitions in the Supreme Court and the High Court under Arts 32 and 226 respectively. The Court observed that a petition based on fresh or additional grounds would not be barred by res judicata. A petition under Artic 32, however, will not lie against the final order of the Supreme Court under art 32 of the constitution. It was held that a petition would not lie under Art 32 challenging the correctness of an order of the Supreme Court passed on a special leave petition under Art 136 of the Constitution setting aside the award the award of enhanced solarium and interest under the land acquisition Act, 1894.Existence of alternative remedies Module – 1 106
When statutory remedies are available for determining the disputed questions of fact or law, such questions cannot be raised through a petition under Art 32.The Supreme Court would not undertake a fact-finding enquiry in the proceedings under Art 32. If the facts are disputed, they must be sorted out at the appropriate forum. In Ujjam Bai v. State of UP ( AIR 1962 SC 1621) the Supreme Court held that a petition under Art 32 could not impugned error of law or fact committed in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on an authority by law. The Court here made a distinction between acts, which were ultra vires, or in violation of the principles of natural justice and those, which were erroneous though within jurisdiction. While the former could be impugned, the latter could not be impugned in a writ petition under art 32. This dictum was, however, narrowed down by subsequent decisions. It was held that where an error of law or fact committed by a tribunal resulted in violation of a fundamental right; a petition under Art 32 would be maintainable.The fact that the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights under Art 32 is a fundamental right should not bind us to the reality that such a right in order to be meaningful must be used economically for the protection of the fundamental rights. However, in recent years, with the expansion of the scope of art 21 of the Constitution and the growth of public interest litigation, the threshold enquiry regarding the violation of fundamental rights has become rare. Article 32 has almost become a site for public interest litigation where fundamental rights of the people are agitated. It is under this jurisdiction that the human rights jurisprudence and environmental jurisprudence have developed.The Court has given such expansive interpretation of art 21 of the Constitution that the question, which seemed to be alien to Art 32, became integral part of it. The right to life and personal liberty came to comprehend such diverse aspects of human freedom such as the right to environment, or the right to gender justice or the right to good governance that questions such as whether the ordinance making power was exercised to defraud the Constitution or whether judges were appointed in such a way as to enhance the indepenence of the judiciary or who and how should a social service organization undertake the giving of Indian children in adoption to foreigners became matters involving fundamental rights. Since the rights to live guaranteed by Art 21 included the right to live with dignity the right to unpolluted environmental jurisprudence has emerged. With the growth of the public interest litigation, which we will discuss separately, Art 32 has become an important site for the vindication of various group human rights. The Court has even incorporated some of the directive principles of state policy within the compass of the fundamental rights. For example, it declared that the right to primary education was a fundamental right. The Supreme Court entertained a writ petition under Art 32 seeking the implementation of the Consumer Protection Act and appointment of district forums as required there under. The CourtModule – 1   107
also entertained a petition which said that due to large backlogs, the under- trail prisoner remained for an inordinately long periods in jail.Principles Regarding Writ Jurisdiction Under Article 226Article 226 empowers the High Courts to issue writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto or any of them for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights or for any other purpose. It has been held that the words ‘for any other purpose’ mean for the enforcement of any statutory or common law rights. The jurisdiction of the High Courts under Art 226 is wider than that of the Supreme Court under Art 32. The jurisdictions under Art 32 and 226 are concurrent and independent of each other so far as the fundamental rights are concerned. A person has a choice of remedies. He may move either the Supreme Court under Art 32 or an appropriate High Court under Art 226. If his grievance is that a right other than a fundamental right is violated, he will have to move the High Court having jurisdiction. He may appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the High Court. After being unsuccessful in the High Court, he cannot approach the Supreme Court under Art 32 for the same cause of action because as said earlier, such a petition would be barred by resjudicata. Similarly, having failed in the Supreme Court in a petition filed under Art 32, he cannot take another chance by filing a petition under Art 226 in the High Court having jurisdiction over his matter because such a petition would also be barred by res judicata.The High Court’s jurisdiction in respect of ‘ other purposes’ is however, discretionary. The courts have laid down rules in accordance with which such discretion is to be exercised. The jurisdiction of the High Court under Art 226 cannot be invoked if:•  The petition is barred by res jusicata;•  If there is an alternative and equally efficacious remedyavailable and which has not been exhausted;•  If the petition raised questions of facts which are disputed;and•  If the petition has been made after an inordinate delay.These rules of judicial restraint have been adopted by our courts from the similar rules developed by the English courts in the exercise of their jurisdiction to issue the prerogative writs.Where a civil court had dealt with a matter and the High Court had disposed of an appeal against the decision of the civil court, a writ petition on the same matter could not be entertained. This was not on the ground of res judicata as much as on the ground of judicial discipline, which required that in matters relating to exercise of discretion, a party could not be allowed to take chance in different forums. Withdrawal or abandonment of a petition under Art Module – 1   108
226/227 without the permission of the court to file a fresh petition there under would bar such a fresh petition in the High Court involving the same subject matter, though other remedies such as suit or writ petition under Art 32 would be open. The principle underlying Rule 1 of Order 23 of the CPC was held to be applicable on the ground of public policy.It is a general rule of the exercise of judicial discretion under Art 226 that the High Court will not entertain a petition if there is an alternative remedy available. The alternative remedy however, must be equally efficacious. Where an alternative and efficacious remedy is provided, the Court should not entertain a writ petition under Art 226. Where a revision petition was pending in the High Court challenging the eviction degree passed against a tenant by the court of the Small Causes, it was held that the High Court should not have entertained a writ petition filed by the cousins of the tenants. The petitioners should have exhausted the remedies provided under the Code of Civil procedure before filing the writ petition. Petitions were dismissed on the ground of the existence of an alternative remedy in respect of elections to municipal bodies or the Bar Council.When a law prescribes a period of limitation for an action, such an action has to be brought within the prescribed period. A court or a tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain an action or proceeding after the expiration of the limitation period. It is necessary to assure finality to administrative as well as judicial decisions. Therefore, those who sleep over their rights have no right to agitate for them after the lapse of a reasonable time. Even writ petitions under Art 226 are not immune from disqualification on the ground of delay. Although the law of limitation does not directly apply to writ petitions, the courts have held that a petition would be barred if it comes to the court after the lapse of a reasonable time. This is however, not a rule of law but is a rule of practice. Where the petitioner shows that illegality is manifest in the impugned action, and explains the causes of delay, the delay may be condoned.Scope of the High court’s Jurisdiction under Article 226The jurisdiction of the High Court under Art 226 is very vast and almost without any substantive limits barring those such as territorial limitations.Although the jurisdiction of the High Court is so vast and limitless, the courts have imposed certain limits in their jurisdiction in order to be able to cope with the volume of litigation and also to avoid dealing with questions, which are not capable of being answered judicially. There are three types of limitations: Module – 1109•  •  • Thos Thos Those arising from judicial policy;e which are procedural ande because of the petitioner’s conduct. 
The Supreme Court has held that the extra ordinary jurisdiction should be exercised only in exceptional circumstances.It was held that the High Court was not justified in going into question of contractual obligations in a writ petition. It was held that the jurisdiction under Art 226 should be used most sparingly for quashing criminal proceedings. The High Court should interfere only in extreme cases where charges ex facie do not constitute offence under the Terrorist and Destructive Activities Act (TADA) It should not quash the proceedings where the application of the Act is a debatable issue.Power to Review Its Own JudgmentsIt was held that the High Court had power to review its own judgments given under Art 226. This power, however, must be exercised sparingly and in cases, which fell within the guidelines provided by the Supreme Court. However, review by the High Court of its own order in a writ petition on the ground that two documents which were part of the record were not considered by it at the time of the issuance of the writ under Art 226, especially when the documents were not even relied upon by the parties in the affidavits filed before the High Court was held to be impermissible.On the death of the petitioner during the pendency of his writ petition against removal from service, the petition abates. The successor cannot continue the petition.If the petitioner were guilty of mala fide and calculated suppression of material facts, which if disclosed, would have disentitled him to the extra ordinary remedy under Art 226 or in any case materially affected the merits of the case, he would be disentitled to any relief. Where the writ petitioners had themselves invoked the review jurisdiction of the competent officer under the Evacuee Interest (Separation) Act, 1950, to their advantage and to the disadvantage of the appellant, it was held that the petitioner could not be heard to say that the review orders of the authority were void for want of jurisdiction.(Rights of the Armed Forces)The Constitution provides two exceptions to the availability of the constitutional remedies given in Art 32, 226 227 and 136. Art 33 of the Constitution says that Parliament may by law determine to what extent any of the rights conferred by Part III shall, in their application to the members of the Armed Forces or the Forces charged with the maintenance of public order, be restricted or abrogated so as to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them.Suspension of Judicial Review during Emergency Module – 1 110
The right to move the court for the enforcement of the fundamental rights be suspended during the emergency. This is the second exception to the availability of constitutional remedies.Under Art 359 of the Constitution the President may declare that the right to move any court for the enforcement of such of the fundamental rights as may be mentioned in the order and all proceedings pending in any court for the enforcement of those rights shall remain suspended for the period during which the Proclamation is in force or for such shorter period as may be specified in the Order. By the Constitution (Forty- fourth) Amendment Act, 1978, the words ‘except Arts 20 and 21’ were added to the above Article. It means that the right to move any court for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights except the rights guaranteed by Art 20 and the President may suspend 21 during the proclamation of emergency.The jurisdiction under Art 227 is narrower than that under Art 226 because while under art 226, the High Court can quash any administrative action, under Art 227, it can act only in respect of judicial or at the most quasi- judicial actions. By giving wider meaning to the word ‘tribunal’ in this Article as well as in Art 136, the courts have included various administrative authorities within the power of superintendence. Clause (4) of art 227, however, excludes the tribunals constituted by or under any law relating to the armed forces from the supervisory jurisdictions of the High Courts. The court martial proceedings under the Military law are not within the power of superintendence of the High Court, though they are subject to judicial review under Art 226.A petition under Art 227 is not maintainable if there is an adequate alternative remedy. In this matter the same principles will apply as are applicable to petitions filed under the Consumers protection act dismissing a petition for non-appearance would not lie under Art 227 to the High Court since the statutory remedy of appealing under sec. 15 or applying for revision under sec. 17 to the State Commission under that Act was available.Remedy through Special Leave to appeal under article 136.Articles 132 to 135 of the Constitution deal with ordinary appeals to the Supreme Court in constitutional, civil and criminal matters. Article 136 deals with a very special appellate jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court. Under this provision the Supreme Court has power to grant in the discretion, special leave to appeal from(a) (b) (c) Any judgment, decree, determination or order; In any cause or matter;An order passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India.Module – 1   111
The scope of the Article is very extensive and it invests the Court with a plenary jurisdiction to hear appeals. Since the Court has been empowered to hear appeals from the determination or orders passed by the tribunal including all such administrative tribunals and bodies which are not Courts in the strict sense, this has become most interesting aspect of this provision from the point of administrative law. Under the provision, the Court may hear appeals from any tribunal even where the legislature declares the decision of a tribunal final.A large number of ad judicatory bodies outside the regular judicial hierarchy have sprung up in modern times and it was deemed highly desirable that the Supreme Court should be able to keep some control over such bodies through the technique of hearing appeal there from. Prof. Jain and Jain have rightly observed it in this connection:“ It is extremely desirable that there should be some forum correct misuse of power by such bodies. To leave these bodies outside the place of any judicial control would be to create innumerable tiny despots, which could negative the rule of law. The ambit of Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under Article 136 is in some respects broader than that under Article 32. Article is confined to the enforcement of fundamental rights only whereas Article 136 is not so. The appellate jurisdiction of the court gives more scope to the Court to intervene with ad judicatory bodies and provides grounds of judicial control. But from another point of view the jurisdiction of the Court under Article 136 is narrower than that under Article 32. Article 136 is available only in cases of tribunals while Article 32 can be invoked when any authority whatsoever infringes a fundamental right. It has been found that the Court has been extremely reluctant to intervene with quasi- judicial bodies. As regard the points of difference between the writ jurisdiction of the High Courts under Article 226 any appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 136, it can be said that a high court can issue a writ to any authority whether quasi-jurisdiction or administrative; whereas the supreme Court under Article 136 can hear appeal only from a court or tribunal. In this respect writ jurisdiction of a High Court is broader than the appellate scope of the Supreme Court under Article 136. But from another point of view the scope of Article 226 is narrower than Article 136. The Supreme Court can interfere with a decision of a tribunal on wider form than the High Court in its writ jurisdiction, are not so flexible it does not enter into questions of facts while there is no restriction on the powers of the Supreme Court.”General principles relating to the grant of special leave to appeal. The following principles have been evolved on the basis of cases decided by the Court, in connection with the grant of special leave to appeal:(1) The Court has imposed certain limitations upon its own powers under Article 136, e.g., it has laid down that the power is to be exercised sparinglyModule – 1   112
and in exceptional cases only. The power shall be exercised only where special circumstances are shown to exist.(2) Ordinarily, the Supreme Court would refuse to entertain appeal under Article 136 from the order of an inferior tribunal where the litigant has not availed himself of the ordinary remedies available to him by law, e.g., a statutory right of appeal or revision or where he has not appealed from the final order of an Appellate Tribunal from the decision of the inferior tribunal.This may be allowed only in exceptional cases e.g., breach of the principles of natural justice by the order appeal to the Supreme Court is on a point, which could not have been decided in the appeal under ordinary law.(3) The reserve power of the court cannot under Article 136 be exhaustively defined but it is true that the Court has acted arbitrarily or has not given a fair deal to the litigant, will not be handicapped in the exercise of its findings of facts or otherwise.(4) It is quite plain that the Supreme Court reaches the conclusion that the tribunal or the Court has acted arbitrarily or has not given a fair deal to the litigant, will not be handicapped in the exercise of its findings of facts or otherwise.(5) The Supreme Court would not permit a question to be raised before it for the first time, if the same has not been raised before the tribunal. But where the question raised for the first time involves a question of law and it arose on admitted facts, then the court may allow the same to be argued before it.The court again said that the point was neither raised in the written statement filed by the appellant in the trail Court nor in the grounds of appeal filed by him in the appellate court cannot be canvassed before the Supreme Court for the first time on appeal by special leave.(6) In an appeal under this provision, the Supreme Court will not interfere with the award of a Tribunal unless some erroneous principle has been invoked or some important piece of evidence has been overlooked or misapplied.Remedy against the administrative tribunal under Article 227 : According to Article 227 (1) as it existed before the 42nd amendment of the Constitution every High Court had the power of superintendence over all Courts and tribunals within its territorial jurisdiction except those which are constituted under a law relating to armed forces. Here the word tribunal was read in the same connotation as it has been used in Article 136. The power of superintendence included the power to call returns from such courts, to make and issue general rules and prescribe forms for regulating the practice and proceedings of such Courts and prescribe forms in which books, entries, and accounts were to be kept by the officers of such Courts. Now under Forty- forth Amendment act of the Constitution the jurisdiction of the High Court overModule – 1   113
administrative tribunals has been restored and accordingly the power of superintendence and supervision of the High Courts over them exists as before.The high Courts were thus empowered to exercise broad powers of superintendence over Courts and tribunals. The power extended not only to administrative but also even to judicial superintendence over judicial or quasi- judicial bodies. The power of the High Court under Article 226 differed from power of superintendence exercised by it under Article 227Firstly, where it could quash orders of inferior court or tribunal, but the court under Article 226 may quash the order as well as issue further directions in the matter.Secondly, Under Article 227 the power of interference was limited to seeing that the tribunal function with in the limits of its authority .Thirdly, the power under Article 227 will only be exercised where the party affected moves the court, while the superintending power under Article 227 could be exercised at the instance of High Court itself.In exercising the supervisory power under Article 227, the High Court does not act as an appellate tribunal. It did not use to review to reweigh the evidence upon which the determination of the inferior tribunal purported to be based.B) Statutory Review.The method of statutory review can be divided into two parts:i) Statutoryappeals.TherearesomeActs,whichprovideforanappeal from statutory tribunal to the High Court on point of law.e.g. Section 30 Workmen’s Compensation act, 1923.ii)C.Reference to the High Court or statement of case. There are several statutes, which provide for a reference or statement of case by an administrative tribunal to the High Court. Under Section 256 of the Income-tax Act of 1961 where an application is made to the Tribunal by the assessee and the Tribunal refuses to state the case the assessee may apply to the High Court and if the High Court is not satisfied about the correctness of the decision of the Tribunal, it can required to Tribunal to state the case and refer it to the Court.)Ordinary Remedies or Equitable RemediesApart from the extra-ordinary (Constitutional Remedies) guaranteed as discuss above there are certain ordinary remedies, which are available toModule – 1   114
person under specific statutes against the administration. The ordinary courts in exercise of the power provide the ordinary remedies under the ordinary law against the administrative authorities. These remedies are also called equitable remedies. This includes:i) Injunctionii) Declaratory Actioniii) Action for damages.) In some cases where wrong has been done to aperson by an administrative act, declaratory judgments and injunction may be appropriate remedies. An action for declaration lies where a jurisdiction has been wrongly exercised. Or where the authority itself was not properly constituted. Injunction s issued for restraining a person to act contrary to law or in excess of its statutory powers. An injunction can be issued to both administrative and quasi-judicial bodies. Injunction is highly useful remedy to prevent a statutory body from doing an ultra vires act, apart from the cases where it is available against private individuals e.g. to restrain the commission or torts, or breach of contract or breach of statutory duty.Before discussing these remedies let us find out what is the meaning of equity.Meaning of EquityBefore we discuss equitable remedies, it is necessary for us to know something about equity. Since the administration of justice has begun on the basis of law in the world, a class of society has always been against the rigidity of law. This class of society is of the opinion that howsoever mature and legally skilled men may make the laws, yet they cannot experience the circumstances which the judges may have to face in future. The circumstances in which the provisions of law may prove to be unjust for the people if is necessary to make the provisions of law flexible, and injustice caused by such rigidity of law should be stopped. Equity is based on this consideration. Equity is a voice against injustice caused by rigidity of low. Equity, which is not a synonym of natural justice, demands that justice should be made in accordance with the circumstances. Equities a new and independent system of law which developed in England. It has its own history and origin. It made an important contribution in the English system of law as a supplementary of main legal system till 1873, when it was merged in the common law According to Ashburner. “Equity is a word which has been borrowed by law from morality and which was acquired in law a strictly technical meaning.”Equitable Remedies may be discussed under following headings: (1) Injunction Module – 1115
An injunction is a preventive remedy. It is a judicial process by which one who has invaded or is threatening to invade the rights of another is restrained from continuing or commencing such wrongful Act.In India, the law with regard to injunctions has been laid down in the specific Relief Act, 1963.Injunction may be prohibitory or mandatory.Prohibitory Injunction. Prohibitory injunction forbids the defendant to do a wrongful act, which would infringe the right of the plaintiff. A prohibitory injunction may be interlocutory or temporary injunction or perpetual injunction.Interlocutory or temporary injunction. Temporary injunctions are such as to continue until a specified time or until the further order of the court. (S. 37 for the specific Relief Act ). It is granted as an interim measure to preserve status quo until the case is heard and decided. Temporary injunction may be granted at any stage of a suit. Temporary injunctions are regulated by the Civil Procedure Code.(Ibid)Temporary injunction is provisional in nature. It does not conclude or determine a right. Besides, a temporary injunction is a mere order. The granting of temporary injunction is a matter of discretion of the court.Perpetual injunction. A perpetual injunction is granted at the conclusion of the proceedings and is definitive of the rights of the parties, but it need not be expressed to have perpetual effect, it may be awarded for a fixed period or for a flexed period with leave to apply for an extension or for an indefinite period terminable when conditions imposed on the defendant have been complied with; or its operation may be suspended fro a period during which the defendant is given the opportunity to comply with the conditions imposed on him, the plaintiff being given leave to reply at the end of that time.Mandatory injunction. When to present the breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel the performance of certain acts which the court in capable of enforcing, the court may in the discretion grant an injunction to prevent the breach complained of an also to compel performance of the requisite acts. (S. 39 of the Specific Relief Act.) The mandatory injunction may be taken as a command to do a particular act to restore things to their former condition or to undo, that which has been done. It prohibits the defendant from continuing with a wrongful act and also imposes duty on him to do a positive act. For example construction of the building of the dependant obstructs the light for which the plaintiff is legally entitled. The plaintiff may obtain injunction not only for restraining the defendant from the construction of the building but also to pull down so much of the part of the building, which obstructs the light of the plaintiff.Declaration (Declaratory Action)  Module – 1 116
Declaration may be taken as a judicial order issued by the court declaring rights of the parties without giving any further relief. Thus a declaratory decree declares the rights of the parties. In such a decree there is no sanction, which an ordinary judgment prescribes same sanctions against the defendant. By declaring the rights of the parties it removes the existing doubts about the rights and secures enjoyment of the property. It is an equitable remedy. Its purpose is to avoid future litigation by removing the existing doubts with regard to the rights of the parties. It is a discretionary remedy and cannot be claimed as a matter of right.Action for DamagesIf any injury is caused to an individual by wrongful or negligent acts of the Government servant the aggrieved person can file suit for the recovery of damages from the Government concerned. This aspect of law has been discussed in detail under the topic liability of Government or state in torts.WRITSWRIT OF HABEAS CORPUSHabeas corpus is a prerogative writ, which was granted to a subject of His Majesty, who was detained illegally in jail. It is an order of release. The words habeas corpus subi di cendum literally mean ‘to have the body’The writ provides remedy for a person wrongfully detained or restrained. By this a command is issued to a person or to jailor who detains another person in custody to the effect that the person imprisoned or the detenu should be produced before the Court and submit the day and cause of his imprisonment or detention. The detaining authority or person is required to justify the cause of detention. If there is no valid reason for detention, the Court will immediately order the release of the detained person.The personal liberty will have no meaning in a constitutional set up if the writ of habeas corpus is not provided therein. The writ is available to all the aggrieved persons alike. It is the most effective means to check the arbitrary arrest by any executive authority. It is available only in those cases where the restraint is put on the person of a man without any legal justification.When a person has been subjected to confinement by an order of the Court, which passed the order after going through the merits of the case the writ of habeas corpus cannot be invoked, however erroneous the order may be. Moreover, the writ is not of punitive or of corrective nature. It is not designed Module – 1   117
to punish the official guilty for illegal confinement of the detenu. Nor can it be used for devising a means to secure damages.An application for habeas corpus can be made by any person on behalf of the prisoner as well as by the prisoner himself, subject to the rules and conditions framed by various High Courts.Thus the writ can be issued for various purposes e. g.(a) (b)(c) (d)(e)When the Writ does not lie.1.2.The writ will not lie in the following circumstances:-If it appears on the face of the record that the detention of the person concerned is in execution of a sentence on indictment of a criminal charges. Even if in such cases it were open to investigate the jurisdiction of the court, which convicted the petitioner, but the mere jurisdiction would not justify interference by habeas corpus.In habeas corpus proceedings the court is to have regard to the legality or otherwise of the detention at the time of the return and not with reference to the date of institution of the proceedings. It was, thus, held in Gopalan v. State,(AIR 1950 SC.27) that if a fresh and valid order justifying the detention is made by the time to the return to the writ, the court couldn’t release the detenu whatever might have been the defect of the order in pursuance of which he was arrested or initially detained.There is no right to habeas corpus where a person is put into physical restraint under a law unless the law is unconstitutional or the order is ultra virus the statute.3.etc.testing the validity of detention under preventive detention laws; securing the custody of a person alleged to be lunatic;securing the custody of minor;detention for a breach of privileges by house;testing the validity of detention by the executive during emergency, Module – 1118
4. Under Article 226 a petition for habeas corpus would lay not only where he is detained by an order of the State Government but also when another private individual detains him.Grounds of Habeas Corpus:The following grounds may be stated for the grant of the writ:(1)(2)The applicant must be in custody;The application for the grant of the writ of habeas corpus ordinarily should be by the husband or wife or father or son of the detenu. Till a few years back the writ of habeas corpus could not be entertained if a stranger files it. But now the position has completely changed with the pronouncements of the Supreme Court in a number of cases. Even a postcard written by a detenu from jail or by some other person on his behalf inspired by social objectives could be taken as a writ-petition.In Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration (AIR 1980 SC.1579) II the court initiated the proceedings on a letter by a co- convict, alleging inhuman torture to his fellow convict. Krishna Iyer, J., treated the letter as a petition for hebeas corpus. He dwelt upon American cases where the writ of habeas corpus has been issued for the neglect of state penal facilities like over-crowding, in sanitary facilities, brutalities, constant fear of violence, lack of adequate medical facilities, censorship of mails, inhuman isolation, segregation, inadequate rehabilitative or educational opportunities.A person has no right to present successive applications for habeas corpus to different Judges of the same court. As regards the applicability of res judicata to the writ of habeas corpus the Supreme Court has engrafted an exception to the effect that where the petition had been(3)(4) Module – 1119
rejected by the High Court, a fresh petition can be filed to Supreme Court under Article 32.(5) All the formalities to arrest and detention have not been complied with and the order of arrest has been made mala fide or for collateral purpose. When a Magistrate did not report the arrest to the Government of the Province as was required under Section 3(2) of the Punjab Safety Act, 1947, the detention was held illegal.(6) The order must be defective in substance, e.g., misdescription of detenu, failure to mention place of detention etc. Hence complete description of the detenu should be given in the order of detention.(7) It must be established that the detaining authority was not satisfied that the detenu was committing prejudicial acts, etc. It may be noted in this connection that the sufficiency of the material on which the satisfaction is based cannot be subject of scrutiny by the Court.Where the detaining authority did not apply his mind in passing the order of detention, the court will intervene and issue the order of release of the detenu. Vague and indefinite grounds of detention.__ where the detaining authority furnishes vague and indefinite grounds, it entitles the petitioner to release.Delay in furnishing ground may entitle detenu to be released.The Court has consistently shown great anxiety for personal liberty and refused to dismiss a petition merely on the ground that it does not disclose a prima facie case invalidating the order of detention. It has adopted the liberal attitude in view of the peculiar socio-economic conditions prevailing in the country. People in general are poor, illiterate and lack financial resources. It would therefore be not desirable to insist that the petitioner should set out clearly and specifically the ground on which he challenges the order of detention.The scope of writ of habeas corpus has considerably increased by virtue of the decision of the Supreme Court in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, and also by the adoption of forty-fourth amendment to the Constitution. Hence theModule – 1   120
writ of habeas corpus will be available to the people against any wrongful detention.WRIT OF MANDAMUSNature and Scope__ A writ of mandamus is in the form of command directed to the inferior Court, tribunal, a board, corporation or any administrative authority, or a person requiring the performance of a specific duty fixed by law or associated with the office occupied by the person.Mandamus in England is “neither a writ of course nor a writ of right, but that it will be granted if the duty is in the nature of public duty and specially affects the right of an individual provided there is no other appropriate remedy.The writ is issued to compel an authority to do his duties or exercise his powers, in accordance with the mandate of law. The authority may also be prevented from doing an act, which he is not entitled to do. The authority, against which the writ is issued, may be governmental or semi-governmental, or judicial bodies. Its function in Indian Administrative Law is as general writ of justice, whenever justice is denied, or delayed and the aggrieved person has no other suitable the defects of justice. An order in the nature of mandamus is not made against a private individual. The rule is now well established that a writ of mandamus cannot be issued to a private individual, unless he acts under some public authority. A writ can be issued to enforce a public duty whether it is imposed on private individual or on a public body.The Court laid down that public law remedy mandamus can be availed of against a person when he is acting in a public capacity as a holder of public office and in the performance of a public duty. It is not necessary that the person or authority against whom mandamus can be claimed should be created by a statute. Mandamus can be issued against a natural person if he is exercising a public or a statutory power of doing a public or a statutory duty.Grounds of the Writ of MandamusThe writ of mandamus can be issued o the following grounds :(i) That the petitioner has a legal right.The existence of a right is the formation of the jurisdiction of a Court to issue a writ of mandamus. The present trend of judicial opinion appears to be that in the case of non-selection to a post, no writ of mandamus lies.(ii) That there has been an infringement of the legal right of the petitioner;Module – 1   121 
(iii) (iv) (v)That the infringement has been owing to non-performance of the corresponding duty by the public authority;That the petitioner has demanded the performance of the legal duty by the public authority and the authority has refused to act:That there has been no effective alternative legal remedy.The applicant must show that the duty, which is sought to be enforced, is owed to him and the applicant must be able to establish an interest the invasion of which has been given rise to the action.The writ of mandamus is available against all kinds of administrative action, if it is affected with illegality. When the action is mandatory the authority has a legal duty to perform it. Where the action is discretionary, the discretion has to be exercised on certain principles; the authority exercising the discretion has mandatory duty to decide in each case whether it is proper to exercise its discretion. In the exercise of its mandatory powers as well as discretionary powers it should be guided by honest and legitimate considerations and the exercise its discretion should be for the fulfillment of those purposes, which are contemplated by the law. If the public authority ignores these basic facts in the exercise of mandatory or discretionary.Where the duty is not mandatory but it is only discretionary, the writ of mandamus will not be issued. The principles are illustrated in Vijaya Mehta v. State(AIR 1980 Raj.207) There a petition was moved in the high Court for directing the state Government to appoint a Commission to inquire into change in climate cycle, flood in the State etc. Refusing to issue the writ, the Court pointed out that under Section 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, the Government is obligated to appoint a commission if the Legislature passes a resolution to that effect.In other situation, the government’s power to appoint a commission is discretionary and optional as a commission could only be appointed by the State Government if, in its opinion it is necessary to do so. The petitioner, therefore has no legal right to compel the State Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry even when there is a definite matter of public importance for the government may not feel inclined to appoint a Commission if it is of the opinion that is not necessary to do so.If the public authority neglects to discharge mandatory duty he would be compelled by mandamus to do it. The refusal to refer to the High Court questions under statutory provision like section 57 of the Stamp Act may be included in the class of mandatory duties in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court in Maharastra Sagar Mills case.Mandamus was issued to compel the government to fill the vacant seats in a Medical College as Article 41 of the Constitution, which is a directive principle of State policy, includes the right to medical education. Module – 1 122
In Bhopal sugar Industries Ltd. V. income Tax Officer, Bhopal, (AIR 1961 SC 182) it was held by the supreme Court that, where the Income Tax Officer had virtually refused to carry out the clear and unambiguous directions which a superior tribunal like the Income tax appellate Tribunal had given to him by its final order in exercise of its appellate power in respect of an order of assessment made by him, such refusal is in effect a denial of justice, and is furthermore destructive of one of the basic principles in the administration of justice based on as it is the hierarchy of Courts. In such a case a writ of mandamus should issue ex-debits justifiable to compel the Income-tax Officer to carry out the directions given to him by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. The High Court will be clearly in error if it refused to issue a writ on the ground that no manifest injustice has resulted from the order of the Income-tax Officer in view of the error committed by the tribunal itself in its order. Such a view is destructive of one of the basic principles of the administration of justice.Thus we find that the Court will not tolerate the omission of mandatory duties by the police authority and it would compel the authority by the writ of mandamus to do what it must.A writ of mandamus will not be issued unless an accusation of non- compliance with a legal duty or a public duty is leveled. It must be shown by concrete evidence that there was a distinct and specific demand for performance of any legal or public duty cast upon the said party declined to comply with the demand.When an original legislation by the Union or State exceeds its legislative orbit and injuries private interests, the owner of such interests can have a mandamus directing the States not to enforce the impugned law “against the petitioners in any manner whatsoever.” The duty of this writ becomes more onerous as it attempts to face different phases and types of ultra vires administrative action, whether with regard to internment or election, taxation or license fees, evacuee property or dismissal of public officers.Grounds on which writ of mandamus may be refused.The relief by way of the writ of mandamus is discretionary and not a matter ofright. The Court on any of the following grounds may refuse it:1. The Supreme Court has held in Daya v. Joint Chief Collector (AIR 1962 SC1796), that where the act against which mandamus is sought has been completed, the writ if issued, will be in fructuous. On the same principle, the Court would refuse a writ of mandamus where it would be meaningless, owing to lapse or otherwise.Who may apply for mandamus? __It is only a person whose rights have been infringed who may apply for mandamus. It is interesting to note that the rule of locus stand has been liberalized by the Supreme Court so much as toModule – 1   123
enable any public-spirited man to move the court for the issue of the writ on behalf of others.General principles relating to mandamus to enforce public duties In considering general principles the following points have to be considered:(a) That the duty is public. In this connection an important case, Ratlam Municipality v. Vardhi Chand (AIR 1980 SC 1622) came to be decided by the Supreme Court in 1980, in which it compelled a statutory body to exercise its duties to the community. Ratlam Municipality is a statutory body. A provision in law constituting the body casts a mandate on the body “ to undertake and make reasonable and adequate provision” for cleaning public streets and public places, abating all public nuisances and disposing of night soil andrubbish etc. duties.(b)(i)(ii)(iii)The Ratlam Municipality neglected to discharge the statutoryThat it is a duty enforced by rules having the force of law. ThusWhere an administrative advisory body is set up (without the sanction of any statute) mandamus will not be issued against such body even through the functions of the body relate to public matters;Though executive or administrative directions issued by a superior authority are enforceable against an inferior authority by departmental action, they have no force of law and are, accordingly not enforceable by mandamus.An applicant for mandamus must take the position that the person against whom an order is sought is holding a public office under some law, and his grievance is that he is acting contrary to the provisions of that law.In short, mandamus will be issued when the Government or its officers either overstep the limits of the power conferred by the statute, or fails to comply with the conditions imposed by the statute for the exercise of the power.Against whom a Writ of Mandamus cannot be issued?Writ of mandamus is issued generally for the enforcement of a right of the petitioner. Where the applicant has no right the writ cannot be issued. It cannot lie to regulate or control the discretion of the public authorities.The writ of mandamus will not be issued if there is mere omission or irregularity committed by the authority. It will not lie for the interference in the internal administration of the authority. In the matters of official judgment, the High Court cannot interfere with the writ of mandamus. Module – 1 124
 WRIT OF CERTIORARIDefinition and Nature : Certiorari is a command or order to an inferior Court or tribunal to transmit the records of a cause or matter pending before them to the superior Court to be dealt with there and if the order of inferior Court is found to be without jurisdiction or against the principles of natural justice, it is quashed:“Certiorari is historically an extraordinary legal remedy and is corrective in nature. It is issued in the form of an order by a superior Court to an inferior civil tribunal which deals with the civil rights of persons and which is public authority to certify the records of any proceeding of the latter to review the same for defects of jurisdiction, fundamental irregularities of procedure and for errors of law apparent on the proceedings.”The jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari is a supervisory one and in exercising it, the Court is not entitled to act as a Court of appeal. That necessarily means that the findings of fact arrived at by the inferior Court or tribunal are binding. An error of law apparent on the face of the record could be corrected by a writ of certiorari, but not an error of fact; however grave it may appear to be.Certiorari is thus said to be corrective remedy. This is, of course, its distinctive feature. The very end of this writ is to correct the error apparent on the face of proceedings and to correct the jurisdictional excesses. It also corrects the procedural omissions made by inferior courts or tribunal. If any inferior court or tribunal has passed an order in violation of rules of natural justice, or in want of jurisdiction, or there is an error apparent on the face of proceeding, the proper remedy so through the writ of certiorari.Certiorari is a proceeding in personam : Unlike the writ of habeas corpus the petition for certiorari should be by the person aggrieved, not by any other person. The effect of the rule of personam is that if the person against whom the writ of certiorari is issued does not obey it, he would be committed forthwith for contempt of court.Certiorari is an original proceeding in the superior Court. It has its origin in the court of issue and therefore the petition in India is to be filed in the High Court under Article 226 or before the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution.Against whom it can be issued : As regards the question against whom the writ can be issued, it is well settled that the writ is available against nay judicial orModule – 1   125

Absence of jurisdiction.Violation of Natural justice. Fraud.Error on the face of records.quasi-judicial authority, acting in a judicial manner. It is also available to any other authority, which performs judicial function and acts in a judicial manner. Any other authority may be Government itself. But the conditions allied with it are that Government acts in a judicial manner and the issue is regarding the determination of rights or title of a person. Previously the question was in doubt whether it was available against Central and Local Governments. The majority of judgment is there, when the grant of certiorari against the Government has been denied. The Madras High Court in 1929 and again in 1940 in Chettiar v. Secretary to the Government of Madras(ILR1940 Mad.205.) held that a writ of certiorari would not lie against Madras Government.The Assam High Court has held that the writ of certiorari will be issued to an authority or body of persons who are under a duty to act judicially. It will not be available against the administrative order or against orders of non-statutory bodies.Necessary conditions for the issue of the Writ : When any body personsHaving legal authority.To determine questions affecting rights of subjects,Having duty to act judicially,Acts in excess of their legal authority, writ of certiorari may beissued. Unless all these conditions are satisfied, mere inconvenience or absence of other remedy does not create a right to certiorari.Grounds of Writ of Certiorari : The writ of certiorari can be issued on the following grounds:Want of jurisdiction : The Supreme Court has stated in Ebrahim Abu Bakar v. Custodian- General of Evacuee Property(111952 SCJ 488), that want of jurisdiction may arise from.(1) (2)The nature of subject matter.From the abuse of some essential preliminary, or Module – 1126
(3) Upon the existence of some facts collateral to the actual matter, which the Court has to try, and which is the conditions precedent to the assumption of jurisdiction by it.It may be added that jurisdiction also depends on(4) The character and constitution of the tribunalThere have been a good number of cases in Indian Administrative Law where the use of jurisdiction has been corrected through the writ of certiorari. Thus the orders of tribunals which did not wait even for 15 minutes to hear a party and which resorted to its own theories to assess the premises of people and acted under the influence of political considerations, have been quashed.The Court does not interfere in the cases where there is a pure exercise of discretion, and which is not arbitrary if it is done in good faith. They do not ignore the legislative intention in the statute which might give a wide aptitude of powers to the administrative authority or the social needs, which demand the bestowal of some wider jurisdiction, or the historical circumstances under which a certain tribunal got exclusive jurisdiction of a particular subject-matter.(2) Violation of Natural Justice The next ground for the issue of writ of certiorari is the violation of natural justice and has a recognized place in Indian legal system as discussed in the earlier part of the reading material.(3) Fraud there are no cases in India where certiorari has been asked on account of fraud. The cases are found in British Administrative law where on the ground of fraud the Court has granted the writ of certiorari. The superior Courts have an inherent jurisdiction to set aside orders of convictions made by inferior tribunals if they have been procured by fraud or collusion a jurisdiction that now exercised by the issue of certiorari to quash Where fraud is alleged, the Court will decline to quash unless it is satisfied that the fraud was clear and manifest and was instrumental in procuring the order impugned.(4) Error of law apparent on the face of record. “An error in decision or determination itself may also be amenable to a writ of certiorari but it must be a manifest error apparent on the face of the proceeding e. g., when it is based on clear ignorance or disregard of the provision of law.” In other words; it is a patent error, which can be corrected by certiorari but not a mere wrong decision. (T. C. Basappa v. T. Nagappa AIR1954 SC 440). It was for the first time when the Supreme Court issued the writ of certiorari on the only ground that the decision of the election tribunal clearly presented a case of error of law, which was apparent on the face of the record. The error must be apparent on the face of the records.Module – 1   127
 (1)(2)(3)(4)The office must have been created by statute, or by the Constitution itself;The duties of the office must be of public nature.The office must be one of the tenure of which is permanent in the sense of not being terminable at pleasure; andThe person proceeded against has been in actual possession and in the user of particular office in question.WRIT OF QUO WARRANTODefinition and Nature. The term quo warranto means “by what authority.” Whenever any private person wrongfully usurps an office, he is prevented by the writ of quo warranto from continuing in that office.The basic conditions for the issue of the writ are that the office must be public, it must have been created by statute or Constitution itself, it must be of a substantive character and the holder of the office must not be legally qualified to hold the office or to remain in the office or he has been appointed in accordance with law.A writ of quo warranto is never issued as a matter of course and it is always within the discretion of the Court to decide.The Court may refuse to grant a writ of quo warranto if it is vexatious or where the petitioner is guilty of larches, or where he has acquiesced or concurred in the very act against which he complains or where the motive of the relater is suspicious.As to the question that can apply for writ to quo warranto, it can be stated that any private person can file a petition for this writ, although he is not personally aggrieved in or interested in the matter.Ordinarily, delay and lashes would be no ground for a writ of quo warranto unless the delay in question is inordinate.An unauthorized person issues the writ in case of an illegal usurpation of public office. The public office must be of a substantive nature.The remedy under this petition will go only to public office private bodies the nature of quo warranto will lie n respect of any particular office when the office satisfies the following conditions: Module – 1 128
Another instance of granting the writ of quo waarrnto is where a candidate becomes subject to a disqualification after election or where there is a continuing disqualification.In cases of office of private nature the writ will not lie. In Jamalpur Arya Samaj Sabha v. Dr. D. Rama, (AIR 1954 Pat 297) the High Court of Patna refuse to issue the writ of quo warranto against the members of the Working Committee of Bihar Raj Arya Samaj Pratinidhi Sabha- a private religious association. In the same way the writ was refused in respect of the office of a doctor of a hospital and a master of free school, which were institutions of private charitable foundation, and the right of appointment to offices therein was vested in Governors who were private an don’t public functionary.It will not lie for the same reason against the office of surgeon or physician of a hospital founded by private persons. Similarly, the membership of the Managing Committee of a private school is not an office of public nature; therefore writ of quo warranto will not lie.In Niranjan Kumar Goenka v. (AIR 1973 Pat 85) The University of Bihar, Muzzafarpur the Patna High Court held that writ in the nature of quo warranto cannot be issued against a person not holding a public office.Acquiescence is no ground for refusing quo warranto in case of appointment to public office of a disqualified person, though it may be a relevant consideration in the case of electionWhen the office is abolished no information in the nature of quo warranto will lie.Good governance is the sine qua non of any State, particularly a democratic polity that would have three organs of government, namely, executive, legislative and judiciary. These three organs constitute as it were three pillars of the good and effective governance with the judiciary functioning as the watchdog for maintenance of the Constitutional balance as the powers and responsibilities of the various machineries of state, vis-à-vis one another, and the people.Public Interest Litigation   Public Interest Litigation PIL Module – 1 129
An individual who does it out of concern for public interest initiates it. But after having initiated it, once the Court admits a matter, it no longer remains the concern only of the person who has initiated it.For example, Sheela Barse, a journalist, had initiated a PIL on behalf of the children who were languishing in remand homes. The respondents were the State governments who prolonged the litigation by not filing their affidavits in time. Sheela Barse had to rush from her home in Bombay to Delhi to attend the Supreme Court every time a date was fixed for a hearing. Exasperated with the willful delay caused by the State Governments, which was not adequately checked by the Court, when threatened to withdraw the petition. Although her frustration was understandable, the court could not allow her to withdraw the petition. Even if she withdrew from the matter, the Court could continue to examine the contentions made by her in the petition and deliver the orders. Although a person may be accorded standing to bring a public interest matter in Court, such a person cannot withdraw proceedings on the ground that she was disassociating herself from that matter. Justice Venkatachaliah (as he then was) speaking for himself and Ranganath Misra J (as he then was) observed that:If we acknowledge any such stands of a dominos lit is to a person who brings a public interest litigation, we will render the proceedings in public interest litigation vulnerable to and susceptible of a new dimension which might, in conceivable cases, be used by persons for personal ends resulting in prejudice to the public weal.Constraints on Public Interest Litigation.Although the courts have been liberal in conceding locus standi to public- spirited citizens to espouse petitions involving public interest, such public interest litigation has got to be constrained by considerations of feasibility as well as propriety. The constraints of feasibility restrain the courts from over admitting matters, which might go beyond its resources to deal with. The consideration of propriety persuades the courts from not undertaking issues, which are better, dealt with by the other co-ordinate organs of the government such as the legislature or the executive.It’s Area of OperationWhile this may be true, as far as popular perception is concerned, the truth, in a deeply vital sense, is that if certain infringement of law, injury to public interest, public loss due to official apathy, inaction or manipulation or dereliction of duty as ordained by the authoritative rules or statutes—which are co relatable to public interest, being offensive to or destructive of it, will all fall within the PIL jurisdiction and judgment given in such cases, in view of their impact and end-result or even visibility in forms of reduction or elimination of the “original sin” are often categorized as pronouncementsModule – 1   130
belonging to the area of the “ judicial activism”. Some of the areas where so- termed judicial activism, emanating from PIL, has been in evidence cover subjects like environment pollution, social ills__ like dowry death/bride burning, bonding labour, child labour, custodial death police torture (Bhagalpur blinding case) and other forms of atrocities on prisoners/jail inmates, non-payment on the part of Ministers/Prime Ministers for private use of public (Air force) air crafts, public compensations, dereliction or abnegation of essential statutory duties by public Institutions/corporations or official bodies. There have been cases where other individual fundamental rights as enshrined in Part III of the Constitution have formed part of PIL as they had under public repercussions. Such PIL cases may be taken directly to Supreme Court where constitutional infringement is involved__ private, i.e., individual rights included. They can also be taken up in High Courts.It’s RationaleUsually, the courts take cognizance of a case when the person affected makes complaint. This is the question of locus standi, that is, whether a person not involved or affected in any case has any legal justification or ground to take up someone else’s case in the constitution on others behalf. The courts were reluctant to accept or admit such cases. But in the early 80s (or may be a little earlier), the Supreme Court made a relaxation of this principle and started accepting genuine and appropriate cases even through complainant was someone different from the person affected. Of course, the admissions done only after a very strict scrutiny of the points involved, the motive or motivation of the complainant and the purpose, which the case, if decided, would serve. It is only after a full satisfaction of the court that such a case is accepted as a PIL.There are many reasons, which dictate the rationale for PIL. In a country like ours, where:(1) Poverty is abysmal.(2) Illiteracy is acute.(3) Society is case ridden.(4) Backwardness is widespread,(5) Fear of the high and might is deep(6) Three M’s (money, muscles and mind) have a sway(7) Communications system is poor,(8) Judicial process is cumbersome and costly, and(9) Justice is denied through delay.It is idle to except that poor, illiterate, disprivileged, weak and vulnerable sections of society, utterly ignorant of the law and the processes of law would come out openly against the abuses of their personal or group rights(al bit legally bestowed), fighting the very people who are often treated, in remote interiors of the country, as Mai-baap (because they are rich, high caste,Module – 1   131
powerful and brutal). Fighting the government can never cross the mind of majority of our people__ as being possible, feasible, desirable or profitable.The only way such a situation can be tackled is if some public-spirited men take up cudgels on their behalf and bring up before law courts cases of law infringement or non-implementation on statutory provisions affecting adversely people or public. The alternative is that the courts suo moto take up some such cases either on the basis of reports, communications or other verifiable evidences. As of now, the courts are well disposed towards this form or course of litigation. They do not or would not reject such a course outright but would take cognizance, even if ultimately they way as well dispose of them or discuss them on good and sufficient grounds.PIL, thus, represents the arguments of both liberals and conservations upholding the soul and sprit of justice through following on initiatory procedure not traditionally preferred or favoured. The former Chief Justice of India, P.N. Bhagwati, sitting with Justice O.A. Desai in 1982 described the diatribe against PIL as:The criticism is based on a highly elitist approach and proceeds from a blind obsession with the rites and rituals sanctified by an out-moded Anglo-Saxom jurisprudence.This aroused the judicial conscience of others. Justice fazal Ali, sitting with Justice S. S. Venkataramiah in the same year referred to the whole gamut of PLIL and the courts’ jurisdiction to a five Judges Bencdh- sensing the importance and relevance of the new reality. Infect, one of the questions formulated was:Can a stranger to a cause- be he a journalist, social worker, advocate or an association of such persons initiate action before the court in matters alleged to be involving public interest or should a petition have some interest in common with others whose rights are infringed by some governmental action or inaction in order to establish the locus stand to make such a complaint?Now, it is no longer in doubt. Even a post card received from a far away place from an unknown man can e treated ass a petition (so goes the report) if it contains valid points worthy of being taken cognizance by the Court. Time have changed, approaches have changed and so have the Courts’ systems – though they are still bogged down in perhaps avoidable rituals which make for delay, add to cost and dilute justice at times. The gradual erosion in principles and values in public life since Nehru and Shastri era in India have brought into sharp focus the constitutional mandate and Supreme Court of India, arousing public interest in the on-going debate over the intentions behind Constitutional provision. It was being widely felt and publicly perceived that the declining values, lack of access to social justice and judicial system, States’ arbitrariness, corrupt practices, attack on rights, grossly deviant social and economic activities, and murder of moral mores cannot make India an honest, progressive and a prosperous society. Module – 1 132
PIL as a Tool for Access of Poor man to JusticeNo less a person than the former Chief Justice of India, A.M Ahmadi, had once described the Supreme Court as the world’s powerful court because of its wide-ranging, vast jurisdiction. Apart from its original, appellate, civil criminal and advisory jurisdictions, it has the power to entertain petitions even from ordinary people who otherwise cannot approach it due to financial and a host of other constraints. In the Fertilizer Corporation Manager Union v. Union of India case, the eminent jurist V.R. Krishna Iyer, the initiator of this innovative process of PIL, described law as “ a social auditor and this audit function can be put into action only when someone with real public interest ignites the jurisdiction of the Court”.In the same vein, the former Chief Justice P.N Bhagwati, picking up the thread from where Iyer left it, propounded in S.P. Gupta’s case, “the court has to innovate new methods and devise new strategies for the purpose of providing access to justice to large masses of people who are denied their basic human rights, the only way in which this can be done is by entertaining writ petitions and even letters from public spirited citizens seeking judicial redress on behalf of those who have suffered a legal wrong or an injury”. At last, the problem of providing justice to millions of helpless and hapless men got recognition PIL fast became one of the most effective and powerful instruments of justice for protecting the weak, the deprived the prosecuted be they women in protective custody, children in juvenile institutions under trial prisoners in jails, unorganized workman, landless labourers, slum and pavement dwellers or people belonging to schedule castes/scheduled tribes. It is the PIL which exposed the brutality of Bhagalpur blinding, merciless exploitation of bonded labour, river (Jamuna) pollution through industrial effluents, environmental degradation, health hazard issues, education capitation rackets and so on.Not remaining confined to righting the wrongs alone, judicial activism has made its presence felt by entering areas traditionally believed to be in the domains of legislature and executive. For instance, the apex judiciary can ask for the records based on which the president and the Governors may have reached their ‘subjective satisfaction’ with regard to, say, failure of constitutional machinery in a state. This, in effect, means that such decisions can be challenged on various grounds like malafides, extraneous considerations, and unreasonableness. Governance, a clear executive function, is now a good subject of judicial activism.Similarly, justice Kuldeep Singh’s directive to the union government for in acting a uniform civil code, one of the unenforceable directive principles of State Policy (Part IV of the constitution) is another example of excessive judicial zeal.Module – 1   133
Again, certain other constitutional provisions, such as the pleasure of the president contained in articles 310, 311 and 312 of the constitution, as well as section 18 of Army Act, which deal with civil services and armed forces respectively, have been brought under judicial control through the ‘creative interpretation’ of articles 14 and 19 of the constitution. The recent “santusti”case is also a case in point. If only establishes the fact that if the constitution provides for any absolute power, it is judiciary’s own authority of judicial review, to say the least. Though such review attempts cannot be branded as “grossly undemocratic”, critics maintain that the courts, ordained as a judicial body, cannot at the same time be looked to as a “general heaven for reform movements”. It cannot, even so, be gainsaid that the need and desirability of judicial activism have clearly been established on the ground; for, more than once, Ð  It has brought out skeletons from administration’s cupboard which remained unexposed for years and would have otherwise remained so for years on end;Ð  It has shown that those in authority abuse and misuse power without compunction for noxious purposes and hide them from public gaze;Ð  All that glitters in the legislative and executive world is not gold. Arbitrariness, greed, corruption, Reports, patronage, the notorious ‘in-law and out-law’ syndrome, ‘private-gain-at public expense’ considerations, malafide motive and many other vilest vices do reign supreme in places and persons who were earlier considered to be ‘paragons of virtue’. Module – 1   134

    Redress of Public Grievances and Institution of OmbudsmanAfter independence setting up of a democratic system of Government raised tremendous hopes and high expectations among people. From a purely regulatory and police administration, the government came to be entrusted with the responsibility of economic and social transformation and that too in a hurry. The state entered economic field in a big way and a number of regulations were brought into play to promote socialistic pattern of the society and to ensure distributive justice.Now let us try to find out the effect of the above upon the lives of the citizens and the type of interface between the government and the citizens it created. The Gandhian principle that, “that governments is the best which governs the least was substituted by a government which was as the American saying goes, a ‘big government’ affecting the lives of citizens from cradle to grave if not from conception itself.The committee on “Prevention of Corruption” (popularly known as the Santhanam Committee) in its report gave special attention to create machinery in the government, which should provide quick and satisfactory redress of public grievances. Accordingly, the Government on June 29, 1964 providing, inter alia, issued detailed instructions:1. It is the basic proposition that the prime responsibility for dealing with a complaint from the public lies with the government organization whose activity or lack of activity gives rise to the complaint. Thus; the higher levels of the hierarchical structure of an organization are expected to look into the complaints against lower levels. If the internal arrangements within each organization are effective enough, there should be no need for a special ‘outside’ machinery to deal with complaints.2. For dealing with grievances involving corruption and lack of integrity on the part of government servants; special machinery was brought into existence in the form of the Central Vigilance Commission.3. For dealing with grievances, while outside machinery was not considered necessary of feasible for the present, the organizations and the departments should provide for quickest redressal of such grievances.4. The internal arrangement for handling complaints and grievance should be quickly reviewed by each ministry, special care being bestowed on the task by those ministries whose work brings them in touch with the public. Every complaint should receive quick and sympathetic attention  Module – 1   137
leaving in the outcome, as far as possible, no ground in the mind of the complaint for a continued feeling of grievance.5. For big organizations having substantial contact with the public, there should be distinct cells under a specially designated senior officer which should function as a sort of outside complaint agency within the organization and, thus, act as a second check on the adequacy of disposal of complaints.Simultaneously, a demand articulated in many, from time to time, for setting up an independent authority with power and responsibility of dealing with major grievances affecting large sections of the people. It was averred that the hierarchical type of remedy for grievances of citizens should be improved by tightening up the existing arrangements and by providing an internal ‘outside’ check to keep things up to the mark. Since the main limitation of the hierarchical remedy is that the various authorities act too departmental check system. A proposal was placed before the Cabinet to the effect that this “extra-departmental check” should operate through a commissioner for redress of Citizens’ grievances, whose main functions should be to ensure that arrangements are made in each ministry/department/office. For receiving and dealing with the citizens’ grievances and that they work efficiently. In exercise of this function, the Commissioner should inspect these units, advise those who hold charge of these units and communicate his observations to the Head of Department or to the Secretary as may be necessary. He should also keep the minister informed of how the arrangements in the department under the minister are working. The proposal in essence was that the Commissioner would be an inspector and supervisor under each minister although located outside. The location for the Commissioner was suggested to be in the Home Ministry from where he would provide a common service. The proposal made it clear that the proposed Commissioner would not be anything like an Ombudsman.Firstly, he would be appointed by the government and not elected by Parliament.Secondly, he would only be an inspector and supervisor of the existing hierarchical arrangements and not an independent investigating authority, like an Ombudsman.Thirdly, the Commissioner would be very much a part of the Government machinery and not an outside agency although he would e outside the individual ministries/departments.The Cabinet approved creation of a Commissioner for Public grievances and an officer of the rank of Additional Secretary was appointed against the post in March, 1966. This arrangement continued for about a year –and –a-half. However, in 1968, the proposal for creation of the institutions of Lokpal and Lokayukta was brought forward in the form of a Bill. During this period, the incumbent in the post moved elsewhere and as an interim measure, pending deliberations on the Bill, the Secretary in the Department of Personnel wasModule – 1   138
asked to perform the functions of the Commissioner. No decision as taken thereafter. Arrangements of the Secretary in the Department of Personnel concurrently functioning as a Commissioner fell into disuse.The system introduced as stated above functioned till March 1985 when a separate Department of Administrative Reforms and Public grievances was set up.A review of the functioning of this system at this stage would be relevant.During the decade 1975-76 to 1984-85 the number of complaints received and disposed of by the Central Government department is given in Table 1.TABLE 1 COMPLAINTS RECEIVED AND DISPOSED OF BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS      Y ear      No. of Complaints   Received       Disposed of     1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980-811981-82 1982-83 1983-84 1984-95   12,27,691 9,13,687 9,75,60610,64,030 10,44,198 11,63,95912,49,024 11,94,973 11,40,0249,49,348   10,07,7248,26,422 9,23,809N.A N.A N.A.9,31,6179,80,878 9,30,472 8,68,628  N.A. Not available.Source: Annual Reports of the Ministry of Personnel (as quoted by M.L. Malhotra in his article in the journal of IIPA)The receipt of complaints hovered around 10-11 lakh and disposal around 9 to 10 lakh, thus, leaving at least one lakh of people every year dissatisfied just on account of non-disposal of their complaints. Despite this, the figures of disposal are not unimpressive. The crucial point, however, is whether the complaints disposed of led to satisfaction of the people or not. Unfortunately, data on this is not available and, therefore, it is difficult to hazard a guess in this matter.Module – 1   139
Reasons of Complaints:Before appraising and pronouncing a judgment on the then existing arrangements, let us first broadly list out reasons due to which grievances normally arise. These can be one or more of the following:1. 2.3. 4.5. 6. 7.Though no empirical data and evidence is available yet the perception of the general public of administrative machinery is not at all a happy one. There is an overwhelming feeling that the procedures take precedence over results; there is no time frame to deal with maters; guidance to the public is inadequate; and that officials deny even simple courtesy to the public. The common man feels alienated from the public because grievances genuine or otherwise are not answered and remedied by the Government. This situation exists because: Delay in disposal of various matters;Dilatory procedures which do not discriminate between routine and urgent;Observance of rules for the sake of their observance without appreciating their effect on the end results;Administrative orders in exercise of discretion by executive which may be open to question either on the ground of misuse or abuse of power resulting in injusticePrevalence of corruption and outside influence; Arbitrariness in executor of authority; and Misconduct and misbehavior.1. 2.3. 4. 5.6.Grievance Officers merely act as a passive agency and they are not vested with authority to redress grievance;Considerable time is taken to provide redress (a sample analysis has revealed that the time taken ranged room six months to six years);The present arrangements are mostly ministry-based and deal with only letters and representations;Too defensive an approach is adopted in dealing with complaints and the tendencies is to justify the action taken already;In spite of many instructions on the subject, the complaint is not given a speaking reply’, i.e. indicating why a particular matter was dealt within a particular fashion;There is room for more active involvement of senior officers in monitoring of grievances disposal; and Module – 1 140
7. Publicity to make people aware of the channels of redress needed stepping up.As mentioned earlier, the institution of commissioner for Public Grievances fell into disuse and there was no central agency to oversee and monitor the working of internal machinery in different organizations. Thus, as rightly pointed by the learned author, Mr. Malhotra, the scenario described above is indeed not a flattering one for the Government.Before concluding discussion on this phase, a reference to the report of the Administrative Reforms Commission will not be out of place. The Commission submitted its report on Machinery floor Redress of . Public grievances in August 1966. The central theme of this report was to create the twin institutions of Lokpal and Lokayukta with authority to investigate both complaints against corruption and grievances.Any progressive system of administration presupposes the existence a mechanism for handling grievances against administrative faults, and the recognition of a right of every member of the public to know what passes in government files. Therefore, the treatment of this subject involves the study of the following topics:Any good system of administration, in the ultimate analysis, has to be responsible and responsive to the people. Because, the chances of administrative faults affecting the rights of the persons, personal or property have tremendously increased and the chances of friction between government and the Private citizen have multiplied manifold therefore, the importance institution like Ombudsman to protect the people against administrative fault cannot be over emphasized.In the mid–nineties the main thrust of the court was public accountability to tackle the problem of corruption high places which was eating into the vitals of the polity. However, in late nineties the emphasis shifted to keeping balance between the needs of public accountability and the demands of individual rights. The canvas grievance redress strategies must be spread wide to include ‘right to know’ and ‘discretion to disobey’ besides other judicial and administrative techniques if the rampant corruption and the abuse of power is to be checked effectively before the people lose complete faith in democracy in India. 1.

 OMBUDSMAN IN INDIAIntroduction. About three decades back, people in parliamentary democracies had firm conviction that the parliamentary process, press and public debates, along with the provisions for the redress by way of the petition to the Government and to the Parliament could adequately remedy the ‘citizens’ grievances and control the arbitrariness of the Executive. Whenever a citizen feels aggrieved by an action of the Government, he could get remedies in the courts and where no action lay in the courts of law, he could ventilate his grievances through petitions, through members of Parliament and finally by voting down the Government in general election if it Is not responsive to his grievances.In past few decades there has been an intensive increase in the Governmental activities. Wide discretionary powers have been given to them, which are susceptible to misuse. It has also multiplied the occasions of individual grievances. Now there are more and more complaints of mal- administration, corruption, nepotism, administrative inefficiency, delay, negligence, bias, unfair preferences or dishonesty. The Justice Report (Justice represents the British Section of the International Commission of Jurists. Its report, was published in 1961) said:“There appears to be a continuous flow of relatively minor complaints not sufficient in themselves to attract public interest but nevertheless of great importance to the individuals concerned, which gives rise to the feelings of frustration and resentment because of the inadequacy of the existing means of seeking redress.” Report P. 37.It has been found that the existing democratic processes under the law are inadequate to deal with the complaints of citizens against the Government. The present scope for judicial review of administrative action is also very meager. There are no proper means of correcting an erroneous decision of facts or investigating into complaints of misconduct, inefficiency, delay or negligence.The only remedy in such cases is to approach the Minister, or to draw the attention by putting questions in the Parliament. It is difficult for an ordinary citizen to do that much. Moreover, in cases of perversity and misconduct of a Minister, the remedy is not clear. Out of two alternatives, namely, to have the ‘Counseil-d-Etat’ under French system of ‘droit administratiff’ or the Ombudsman in the Scandinavian system, most of the modern countries of the world have preferred the latter one as a suitable means for redressing innumerable wrongs of the Government officials. Module – 1 142
The problems of citizen’s grievance that have been germinated by a welfare State have caught the attention of the world for establishing an institution like Ombudsman. Prof. Rawat has rightly predicated that the “Ombudsman institution or its equivalent will become a standard part of the machinery of Government throughout democratic world.”Ombudsman originated in Sweden in 1809 was adopted in Finland in 1919 and Denmark in 1955. It was set up in New Zealand, a commonwealth country with parliamentary form of government in 1962. The ‘Justice’, a British wing of the international Commission of Jurists recommended that it be set up in England and the Parliamentary Commissioner’s Act, 1967 was passed. Ombudsman has come to stay in England. (See MP Jain The First Year of Ombudsman in England 14 JILI 159 (1972); David William’s Parliamentary Commissioner Act. 1967 30 Mod LR 547 (1967); L Cohen The Parliamentary Commissioner and MP Filter Public Law 204 (1972).The Ombudsman type of machinery has been found to be useful for redressing the grievances of citizens, which fall in the above description. It contains some of the qualities of droit administratif.The Ombudsman is an officer of Parliament who investigates complaints from citizens, against government departments, that they have been unfairly dealt with and if he finds that the complaint is justified, helps to obtain a remedy. He has usually a high status- that of a judge of the highest court and can investigate act involving corruption and mal- administration by government officials, sometimes including ministers. The Ombudsman system is highly flexible. This is demonstrated by its successful adaptation in four Scandinavian countries, which have significant governmental and legal difference, and in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, which have an entirely different constitutional system. The Ombudsman of each country has been designed to suit the local needs and conditions. Hence there are differences in them with respect to jurisdiction as well as functions. For example, the Swedish and Finnish Ombudsmen have jurisdiction over the judiciary. The Ombudsman in New Zealand, Denmark and Norway has no authority over the judiciary. The Swedish Ombudsman has no jurisdiction over the ministers. His function is generally to supervise how judges, government officials and other civil servants observe the laws and to prosecute those who have acted illegally or neglected their duties. The Danish Ombudsman has authority over the ministers as well as the judges. The Norwegian Ombudsman has authority to scrutinize the acts of ministers, which they perform as heads of a Ministry. The Finnish Ombudsman not only has jurisdiction over the Cabinet Ministers but also has authority to prosecute them.OMBUDSMAN IN INDIAModule – 1   143
Thus we have seen that the establishment of the institution of Ombudsman is the demand of time. It will be much useful in redressing the grievances of the citizens against the administration. Attempts have been made to establish the institution like Ombudsman (called Lokpal) but unfortunately it has not been established so far. However the institution of Lokayukta is functioning in some Indian States.The system of Ombudsman enables Parliament and Ministers both to correct the faults in the administration. The ministerial responsibility appears to have resulted in sheltering the mistakes in the administration. Often they make defensive answer in Parliament and found reluctant in admitting mistakes. In such a situation the system of Ombudsman is of much use. The existence of Ombudsman will encourage the administration to be sensitive to the public opinion and the demands of fairness. It will help in controlling the administration.The Administrative Reform commission has recommended for the establishment of Ombudsman type of institution in India. A Draft Bill was appended to the Interim Report of the administrative Law Commission. In 1968 a Bill called the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha but before it could be passed, the Lok Sabha was dissolved and therefore the Bill lapsed. In 1971 and another Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha but again the Bill lapsed on account of the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. In 1977 a new Bill called Lokpal Bill, 1977 was introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Bill was referred to the Joint Select Committee of the two House of Parliament but the Bill again lapsed on account of the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. Again Lok Pal Bill, 1985 was introduced in the Lok Sabha and it also lapsed because before its passage the term of the Lok Sabha ended. Again features of the Lokpal Bill, 1989 are as follows:This Bill seeks to establish the institution of Lokpal. The institution of Lokpal shall consist of a Chairman and two members who may be either sitting or retired Judges of the Supreme Court. Where all or any of the allegation have been substantiated against a Minister, the Prime Minister will decide the action to be taken on the recommendation of the Lokpal and in the case of Prime Minister the Lok sabha will decide the action to be taken thereon. In case the allegation is not substantiated wholly or partly, the Lokpal will close the case. The Lokpal has not been given jurisdiction to enquire into the allegation against the President, the Vice President, the Speaker of Lok Sabha, the Chief Justice or any Judge of the Supreme Court, the Comptroller and auditor General, the Chief Election Commissioner or Election Commissioner, the Chairman or any Member of the Union Public Service Commission. The Institution cannot enquire into any matter concerning any person if the Lokpal or any member thereof has any bias in respect of the person or matter. Lokpal cannot enquire into any matter referred for enquiry under the Commission of Enquiries Act. Besides, Lokpal cannot enquire into any complaint made five years after the date of offence stated in the complaint.Module – 1   144
The salary, service conditions and removal from the office in the case of the Chairman will be the same as those of the Chief Justice of India and in the case of other member will be as those of the Judges of the Supreme Court. These provisions have been made to ensure the independence of the institution of Ombudsman. The Bill also provides that a member of the Lokpal cannot be a Member of Parliament or State legislature or a political party. It also provides that a member thereof should not hold any office of trust or profit or he should not carry on any business or practice any profession. The Bill also makes provision for the appointment of staff to assist the Lokpal.The Lokpal can entertain a complaint from any person other than a public servant. The Bill has empowered the Lokpal to require a public servant or any other person to give such information as may be desired or to produce such documents, which are relevant for the purposes of investigation. He will have the powers of a Civil Court under the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 with respect:i) to summon a person and examine him on oath;ii) to require a person to disclose and produce a document;iii) to take evidence on oath;iv) to require any public document or recorded to be placed beforehim;v) to issue commission for the examination of evidence anddocuments;vi) any other matters as may be provided.In August 1998 the Prime Minister Atal Bihari Bajpae presented the Lok Pal Bill in the Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister has also been brought within the jurisdiction or power of LokPal. Under the Bill the LokPal was empowered to make enquiries in the charges of completion brought before, it against any Minister or Prime Minister or Member or either House of Parliament. However, he was not empower thereon the Bill to make enquires in the charges of corruption against the President, Vice- President, Speaker of Lok Sabha, Comptroller and Auditor general, Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioner, Judges of the Supreme Court and Members of the Union Public Service Commission. Under this Bill the institution of Lok Pal was to consist of three members including its Chairman. Only the sitting or retired Chief Justice of India or any Judge of the Supreme Court could be appointed its Chairman while any sitting or retired Judge of the Supreme Court of Chief Justice of any High Court could be appointed its members.  Module – 1 145
The appointment was to be made by President on the recommendation of the selection committee consisting of seven members. The Vice-President would be the Chairman of this selection committee.The Bill has not been enacted into Act.The establishment of Ombudsman in India is the demand of time. The consciousness of the existence of Ombudsman will make the administration more sensitive to the public opinion and to the demands of fairness.• • It is better to give Constitutional status to the institution of Ombudsman.The functioning of the proposed institution of Lokpal may be greatly improved by securing for him a constitutional position like the Election Commission under Article 324.It must be noted that though the Ombudsman may take pressure off the courts and prevent legal principles being strained, yet he is not a panacea for all the evils of bureaucracy. His function is to tidy up and improve administration. His success depends on the existence of a reasonably well- administered State. He cannot cope with the situation where the administration is riddled with patronage and corruption. (Prof. Gellhorn quoted by R. L. Narasimahan in “The Indian Ombudsman Proposal: A Critique”, law and the Commonwealth P. 35. For an exhaustive analysis see M. P. Jain: lokpal: Ombudsman in India, (1970); P. K. Tripathi: Lokpal: The proposed Indian Ombudsman, 9 JILI 135 (1967) and Rajeev Dhawan: Engrafting Ombudsman Idea on a Parliamentary Democracy-A Comment on Lokpal Bill, 1977, 19 JILI 257 (1977).Though the birth of an Ombudsman in the Centre is still doubtful, but for the States it has become a cherished institution.The institution of Lokayukta is functioning in 13 States. These States are: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujrat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Punjab and Haryana.In Tamil Nadu and Jammu & Kashmir different investigating agencies are functioning [see the Tamil Nadu Public Men (Criminal Misconduct) Act, 1973 and the Jammu & Kashmir Government Servants (Prevention of Corruption) Act, 1975]. A similar proposal is pending in the State of Kerala [See Public Men (Investigation About Misconduct) Bill, 1977]. Delhi has also established the institution of Ombudsman. Module – 1 146
Working of Lokayuktas in the StateThe fact of the establishment of the institution of Ombudsman in States proves beyond doubt that the assumption of accepting the “system of responsible government” and the consequential “ministerial responsibility” as a means of providing continuous oversight over the administration is not wholly correct. A Lokayukta can be much more effective than a member of Parliament or State Legislature because of his freedom from political affiliation land because of access to departmental documental. The following tables would show the working of the Lokayuktas in various states.(As quoted in I. P. Messey ‘s book on adm. law.ed. 2001)State of Assam   Y ear B.

It is clear beyond doubt that the number of complaints received by the Lokyuktas isModule – 1   148
constantly increasing. But a large number of them are fielded because of various reasons, which may include:This indicates that the people while filing complaints have not acted with restraint and responsibility. Another important reflection from the above tables is that the cases in which grievances were redressed is highly negligible. This establishes at the practical ineffectiveness of this institution in the Indian situation was lack of administrative cooperation and the apathy of political high-up is significantly marked. However, it has no reflection on the Lokayukta therapy if properly administered.Much information is not available about the types of complaints received by the Lokayuktas in various States but whatever information is available clearly indicates that the main areas of grievance include police action or inertia, prison torture, mala fide exercise of power and demand or acceptance of illegal gratification.A survey of state enactments relating to Lokayukta indicates that there is no uniformity in the provisions of these enactments. In some states, grievances against administration are within the jurisdiction of Lokayukta, while in other states such grievances are kept out of its jurisdiction. In some enactments jurisdiction of Lokayukta extends to only a limited number of public functionaries while in others even vice-chancellors and Registrars of the Universities have been brought under its jurisdiction. In some states the Chief Minister has been brought within the purview of the Act, while in some cases he is not. Similar is the cases with the members of the legislatures. There is no uniformity in the qualification, emoluments. allowance, status and powers of Lokayukta. Only in some enactments power of search and seizure and power to take action suo motu have been given to Lokayukta. in some states budget of the Lokayukta office is charged on the consolidated funds of the state but in others it id not done. Power to punish for its contempt is conferred upon the institution of Lokayukta in some states only. In the same manner only a few states have put independent investigative machinery at the disposal of Lokayukta. in some states Lokayukta has been given some other additional functions to perform also in order to make the institution cost- effective. Besides these, there are various other matters where there is no uniformity in state enactments. Lack of jurisdiction, Triviality,Baseless ness, Anonymity orPseudonym, etc. Module – 1 149
Institution of Lokayukta has not been given any constitutional status, hence, its existence and survival completely depends at the sweet-will of the state government. For political reasons State of Orissa issued an ordinance in 1992 for the abolition of Lokayukta institution. It for same reason Haryana repealed Lokayukta Act in 1999.It is tragic that in some states this institution was established not for prevention of corruption but for harassing and intimidating political opponents and for protecting the ruling elite. it is for this reason that the government are keen that the lokayukta should be their own nominee. Supreme Court had to quash the appointment of Lokayukta of Punjab, Justice H. S. Rai, because the Chief Justice of the High Court had not been consulted.In the same manner Justice vanish was removed from the office of Lokayukta of Haryana by repealing the Act because the Act had made removal of Lokayukta cumbersome by the outgoing government.This is a dangerous sign when a good institution is being allowed to be destroyed in party politics.Whether the recommendations of the Lokayuta or Upa-Lokayukta are mere recommendations or have a binding effect is a question, which deserves serious consideration.The Apex Court in Lokayukta/Upa-Lokayukta v. T. R. S. Reddy32 (1997) 9 SCC 42.) opined that since the Lokayuktas/Upa-Lokayuktas are high judicial dignitaries it would be obvious that they should be armed with appropriate powers and sanctions so that their opinions do not become mere paper directions. Proper teeth and claws so that the efforts put in by them are not wasted and their reports are not shelved.CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION (CVC)In any system of government, improvements in the grievance redressal machinery have always engaged the attention of the people. This system no matter, howsoever, ineffective completely fails when inertia and corruption filter from the top. It was against this backdrop that the establishment of the Central vigilance Commission (CVC) was recommended by the Committee on Prevention of Corruption, the Santhanam Committee. The committee now after the name of its Chairman was appointed in 1962. It Module – 1   150
recommended the establishment of a Central Vigilance Commission as the highest authority at the head of the existing anti-corruption organization consisting of the Directorate of General Complaints and Redress, the Directorate of Vigilance and the Central Police Organization.The jurisdiction of the Commission and its powers are co-extensive with the executive powers of the Center. The government servants employed in the various ministries, and departments of the Government of India and the Union territories, the employees of public sector undertakings, and nationalized banks, have been kept within its purview. The Commission has confined itself to cases pertaining only: (i) to gazetted officers, and (ii) employers of public undertakings and nationalized banks, etc. drawing a basic pay of Rs. 1,000 per month and above.Service Conditions and Appointment of Vigilance Commissioner : -The Central Vigilance Commissioner is to be appointed by the President of India. He has the same security of tenure as a member of the Union Public Service Commission. Originally he used to hold office for six years but now as a result of the resolution of the Government in 1977, his interest for not more than two years. After the Commissioner has ceased to hold office, he cannot accept any employment in the Union or State Government or any political, public office.He can be removed or suspended from the office by the President on the ground of misbehavior but only after the Supreme Court has held an inquiry into his case and recommended action against him.Procedure:The Commission receives complaints from individual persons. It also gather information about corruption and malpractices or misconduct from various sources, such as, press reports, information given by the members of parliament in their speeches made in parliament, audit objections, information or comments appearing in the reports of parliamentary committees, Audit Reports and information coming to its knowledge through Central Bureau of Investigation. It welcomes the assistance of voluntary organizations like Sadachar Samiti and responsible citizens and the press.The Commission often receives complaints pertaining to maters falling within the scope of the State Governments. Where considered suitable, such complaints are brought to the notice of state vigilance commissioners concerned for necessary action. Similarly, they forward complaints received by the State Vigilance Commission in regard to matter falling within the jurisdiction of the Central Government, to the Central Vigilance Commission for appropriate action.The Central vigilance Commission has the following alternatives to deal with these complaints:Module – 1   151
a) b) c)It may entrust the matter for inquiry to the administrative Ministry/Department concerned.It may ask the Central Bureau of Investigation (C. B. I) to make an enquiry.It may ask the Director of the C. B. I to register a case an investigate it.It had been given jurisdiction and power to conduct an enquiry into transaction in which publics servant are suspected of impropriety and corruption including misconduct, misdemeanor, lack of integrity and malpractices against civil servants. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in its operations assisted the Commission. The CVC has taken a serious note for the growing preoccupation of the CBI with work other than vigilance. Thus when the CBI is extensively used for non-corruption investigation work such as drug- trafficking, smuggling and murders it hampers the work of the CVC.But how effective this institution has proved in uprooting corruption depends on various factors, the most important being the earnestness on the part of the government, citizens and institutions to clean public life .In its efforts to check corruption in public life and to provide good governance the Apex Court recommended measures of far-arching consequences while disposing a public interest litigation petition on the Jain Hawala Case. Three- Judge Bench separated four major investigating agencies from the control of the executive. These agencies are:Central Bureau of Investigation; Enforcement Directorate;Revenue Intelligence Department and The Central Vigilance Commission.The Court has shifted the CBI under the administrative control of the CVC. The Central Vigilance Commission, until now, was under the Home Ministry entrusted with the task of bringing to book cases of corruption and sundry wrongdoings and suggesting departmental action. Now the CVC is to be the umbrella agency and would coordinate the work of three other investigating arms.In order to give effect to the view of the Supreme Court, the movement issued an ordinance on August 25, 1998. However, this measure had diluted the views of the Supreme Court by pitting one view against the other. Therefore, what ought to have been visualized as a reformative step had begun to seen as a cleaver bureaucratic legalese.It was when the Supreme Court expressed concern over these aspects of the Ordinance in the hearing relating to its validity that the government decided to Module – 1   152
amend the Ordinance and thus, on October27, 1998 Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Ordinance was issued. The Commission was made a four-member body and its membership was opened to other besides bureaucrats. In the same manner the single directive of prior permission was deleted and the membership of Secretary Personnel, Government of India was deleted.It is too early to comment on the functioning of the reconstituted statutory Central Vigilance Commission but one thing is certain that no commission can root out corruption, which has sunk so deep in the body politic. It can only act as a facilitator and propellant.Central Bureau of InvestigationApart from vigilance organization in every ministry and department, the centralized agency fro anti-corruption work viz. the Central Bureau of Investigation, which functions administratively under the Department of Personnel and administrative Reforms. The latter formulates all policy matters pertaining to vigilance and discipline among public servants. It also coordinates the activities of various heads of departments and functions as the nodal authority in the matter of administrative vigilance. It also deals with (i) vigilance cases against the officers belonging to the Indian Administrative Service and the Central Secretariat Service (Grade-I) and above of the service); and administrative matters connected with the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Central Vigilance Commission as also with the policy matters relating to powers and functions of the Commission.The role of the Central Bureau of Investigation may be shortly described as follows:1) It can take up investigations against the higher levels and in complex cases.2) I t is resourceful and can get material from various sources which may not be available to normal departmental machinery.3) Even if its cases in the early year proved to be weak, it is now encouraging to see that the Central Bureau of Investigation takes up only those cases for prosecution which are sound and strong.The most important need in the interest of efficiency and progress is to fix a time schedule for a case to demarcate clear fields of responsibility between the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Central Vigilance commission.RIGHT TO KNOW  Module – 1153
Government openness is a sure technique to minimize administrative faults. As light is a guarantee against theft, so governmental openness is a guarantee against administrative misconduct.Openness in government is gaining lot of foothold in recent years. It is a topic of growing importance in administrative law.The goal of open government is being pursued by U.S.A, Aaustralia Newzealand and other liberal democracies of the world. Openness in government is bound to act as a powerful check on the abuse of power by the government. The objective of openness in government is ensured by giving access to by the individual to governmental information so that governmental activity is not shrouded in mistery and secrecy.American Constitution, the oldest written constitution of the world, does not contain specific right to information. However, the US Supreme Court has read this right into the First amendment of the Constitution and granted access to information where there is a tradition of openness to information in question and where access contributes to the functioning of the particular process involved. Administrative Procedure Act, 1946 (APA) was the first enactment, which provided a limited access to executive information. The Act was vague in language and provided many escape clauses.Taking these deficiencies into consideration the Congress in 1966 passed Freedom of Information Act, 1966, which gives every citizen a legally enforceable right of access to government files and documents, which the administrators may be tempted to keep confidential. If any person id denied this right, he can seek injunctive relief from the court.1. Information specifically required by executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy.2. Information related solely to internal personal use of the agency3. Information specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.4. Information relating to trade, commercial or financial secrets.5. Information relating to inter-agency on intra-agency memorandumsor letters.6. Information relating to personal medical files.7. Information complied for law enforcement agencies except to theextent available by law to a party other than the agency.After investigating the operation of this Act, Congress in 1974 amended it. Amendments provided:(i) For disclosure of “any reasonably segregably portion” of otherwise exempted records;(ii) For mandatory time limit of 10 to 30 days for responding to information requests;Module – 1   154
(iii) For rationalized procedure for obtaining information, appeal and cost. Statistics show that maximum (80%) use of this act is being made by business executives their lawyers an editors, authors, reporters and broadcasters whose job is to inform the people have made very little use of this Act.The judiciary In USA shares the same concern of the Congress, which is reflected in the Freedom of Information Act, 1966.Justice Douglas observed: “Secrecy in government is fundamentally anti- democratic, perpetuating bureaucratic errors. Open discussing based on full information debate on public issues is vital to our national health.”In order to provide access to Federal government meetings, the Congress passed Sunshine Act, 1977In England the thrust of the legislations on ‘information’ but secrecy the present law is contained in the Official secrets acts, 1911, 1920 and 1939. Keeping in view the desirability of openness of governmental affairs in a democratic society, the Franks Committee recommended a repeal Section 2 of the 1911 Act and its replacement by the Official information Act. The proposals restricted criminal sanctions to defined areas of major importance: wrongful disclosures of (i) information of major national importance in the fields of defense security foreign relations, currency and reserves, (ii) cabinet documents, and (iii) information facilitating criminal activity or violating the confidentiality of information supplied to the government by or about individuals, and these of information for private gains.In 1993, the government in England published a white paper on ‘open government’ and proposed a voluntary code of practice of providing information. This code is voluntary and thus cannot be equated to statutory law on access to information.The local government (Access to Information) Act, 1985 is the only statutory law providing legal right to information against local’s governors. The Act provides for greater public access to meetings and documents of the major local councils. However, this Act leaves much to the discretion of the councils and mentions at least fifteen categories of exempted information. Individual seeking information has no adequate legal redress. It is certainly strange that a democratic country should be so secretive. It appears that this situation cannot last long because of mounting popular pressure and citizens charter.The Official Secrets Act, 1923 in India makes all disclosures and use of official information a criminal offence unless expressly authorized.Courts in India and England have rejected the concept of conclusive right of the government to withhold a document. But still there is too much secrecy, which is the main cause of administrative faults. Module – 1 155
India Constitution does not specifically provide for the right to information as a fundamental right though the constitutional philosophy amply supports it.In the same manner arts. 19 (a) freedom of thought and expression and 21 right to life and personal liberty would become redundant if information is not freely available Art. 39(a), (b), (c) of the Constitution make provision for adequate means of livelihood, equitable distribution of material resources of the community to check concentration of wealth and means of production. As today information is wealth, hence, need for its equal distribution cannot be over emphasized. Taking a cue from this Constitutional philosophy, the Supreme Court of India found a habitat for freedom of information in Arts. 19(a) and 21 of the Constitution.It is heartening to note that the highest Bench in India while recognizing the efficacy of the ‘right to know’ which is a sine qua not of a really effective participatory democracy raised the simple ‘right to know’ to the status of a fundamental right.In S. P. Gupta v. Union of India, the court held that the right to know is implicit in the right of free speech and expression guaranteed under the Constitution in Article 19 (1) (a). The right to know is also implicit in Article 19(1)(a) as a corollary to a free press, which is included in free speech and expression as a fundamental right. The Court decided that the right to free speech and expression includes(i) Right to propagate one’s views, ideas and their circulation(ii) Right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas(iii) Right to inform and be informed(iv) Right to know(v) Right to reply and(vi) Right to commercial speech and commercial information.Furthermore, by narrowly interpreting the privilege of the government to withhold documents under Section 123 of the Evidenced Act, the Court has widened the scope for getting information from government file. In the same manner by narrowly interpreting the exclusionary rule of art. 72 (2) of the Constitution, the Court ruled that the Court could examine the material on which cabinet advice to the President is based. However, this judicial creativity is no substitute for a constitutional or a statutory right to information.With the judicial support, the right to information has now become a cause of public action and there is a strong demand for a formal law on freedom of information. States of Goa, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan have, since 1997, enacted laws ensuring public access to information, although with various restraints and exemptions. There is a pressure on the Central Governments also to enact law-granting right to information. Various drafts were submittedModule – 1   156
fro consideration by empowered bodies like the Press Council of India and by independent citizens’ groups. but the Freedom of Information Bill, which has finally reached Parliament in 1999, has disappointed almost all who campaigned for its introduction.This Press Council of India Bill, 1996 had provided three exemptions, which included:(1)(2)(3)Information, disclosure of which will have prejudicial effect on sovereignty and integrity of India, security of State and friendly relations with foreign states, public order, investigation of an offence which leads to incitement to an offence;Information which has no relationship to any public activity and would constitute a clear and unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;Trade and commercial secrets protected by law.However, the information, which cannot be denied to Parliament or State Legislator, shall not be denied to any citizen. Present government bill tightens all these exemptions while adding several more. One such exemption is in respect of cabinet papers, including records of deliberations of Council of Ministers, Secretaries and other officers. This would make the conduct of all officers of stat immune from public scrutiny. Another exemption relates to the legal advice, opinion or recommendations made by an executive decision or policy formulation this confers too far-reaching immunity on officials. However, in one respect the bill marks a definitive advance over the initial draft in doing away with the exemption on information connected to the management of personnel of public authorities. This makes information available relating to recruitment process on public agencies, which is often riddled with corruption and nepotism. The bill is highly inadequate in respect of credible process of appeal and penalties for denial of information. The jurisdiction f the courts ha been ruled out since the bill makes provision for an administrative appeal only. The officers who would deal with the requests for information are totally unencumbered by the prospects of any penalty for willful denial of any access. Nevertheless, in spit of these limitations, the proposed Bill is a right step in the right direction.Right to know also has another dimension. The Bhopal gas tragedy and its disaster syndrome could have been avoided had the people known about the medical repercussions and environmental hazards of the deadly gas leaked from the Union Carbide chemical plant at Bhopal.In India bureaucrats place serious difficulties in the way of the public’s legitimate access to information. The reason for this can be found in colonial heritage.Module – 1   157
Today in India secrecy prevails not only in every segment of governmental administration but also in public bodies. Statutory or non-statutory. There is a feeling everywhere that it pays to play safe. Even routine reports on social issues continue to be treated as confidential long after the you are submitted. What is given out is dependent on the whims of a minister or a bureaucrat. The result is that there is no debate on important matters and no feedback to the government on the reaction of the people. The stronger the efforts at secrecy, the greater the chance of abuse of authority by functionaries.There is need for administrative secrecy in certain cases. No one wants classified documental concerning national defiance and foreign policy to be made public till after the usual period of 35 years is over. Secrecy may also be claimed for other matters enumerated in the Freedom of Information Act, 1966. But the claims of secrecy, generally by the government and public bodies, may play havoc with the survival of democracy in India.Some legislation, therefore, is necessary which recognizes the right to know, makes rules fro the proper ‘classification of information’ and makes the government responsible to justify secrecy. This will not only strengthen the concept of open government, but also introduce accountability in the system of government., Outside the government, there is no justification for secrecy in public undertakings except within a very limited area of economic espionage.Sometime there appears to be a conflict between the right to know and the right to privacy of public figures through whom the machinery of government moves. Our experience in India suggests that a public figure should not be allowed protection against exposure of his private life, which has some relevance to the public duties on the plea that he has a right to privacy. Right to privacy should not be allowed as a pretext to suppress information.DISCRETION TO DISOBEYIn a country like India where people have no right to know, the judicial process grinds slow and the other grievance procedures are feeble and inefficient, perhaps the discretion to disobey may provide an effective check on the operation of the governmental machinery in reckless manner. It is gratifying to note that at a time when we are not only governed but administered, the Supreme Court has rightly taken the right foot forward in allowing discretion to disobey void orders. The decision of the Supreme Court in Nawab-Khan Abbaskhan v. State of Gujarat ,(AIR 1974 SC 1471).allows every person the discretion to make his own decision and disobey an order of the government, if in his opinion it is void. If he turns out to be wrong in his decision, of course, he is answerable, but if he is right he is not answerable in any way.In this case, the petitioner was prosecuted under Section 142 of the Bombay Police Act, 1951 because he had violated the externment order passed by the Police Commissioner. The trial court acquitted the accused but on appeal by the State, the High Court reversed the order of the lower court. The important Module – 1   158
fact in this whole process was that the accused had challenged the validity for fight externment order before the High Court under Article 226 during the pendency of his criminal trial and the High Court quashed the order on July 16,1968. The accused took the defiance in criminal appeal proceedings before the High Court that since the order becomes void ab intio and they’re being no externment order in the eye of the law there is no offence when he re-entered the forbidden area on September 17, 1967. The question whether a person can disobey the order with impunity if subsequently that order is quashed was answered by the High Court in the negative.On appeal the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the High Court and held that the externment order is of no effect an its violation is no offence. The individual decision-making by private persons of public actions may be considered as a very radical approach but the alternative is a travesty of constitutional guarantees. Grave consequences involved in allowing discretion to disobey someone may argue may first lead to anarchy and then to tyranny.What is the remedy available to a person who has been subjected to an illegal order? Our legal system does not recognize the right to compensation for damage suffered by a person in obeying a valid orderPublic Enterprises.With the steady increase in state functions corresponding to the change in the philosophy of state activity (from laissez faire to social welfare), it is generally an accepted notion n modern states, especially the developing, that ownership of most of the natural resources and capital heavy industries should increasingly rest in the state. In developing countries, state intervention in economic and industrial enterprises has become almost compulsory for various reasons.The major reasons for state intervention in economic activity are:•  to build up an industrial infrastructure and raise productivity;•  increase employment and general standard of living by accelerating national growth and development;•  to render needed services and cater to public utilities like power, transportation and communication which are capital heavy investments and strictly unprofitable under private enterprises;•  to provide sources of credit to finance agricultural and industrial product ional and trade; and  Module – 1159
•  to reduce dependence on foreign capital and aid in the long run.Most developing countries suffer from acute lack of capital, entrepreneurial skills and regional imbalances. The two main aims of all developing societies are to raise levels of productivity and strive towards creation of an equalitarian and just social order. The immensity of the socio-economic problems of these countries makes state intervention inevitable and in fact desirable. The state becomes a vital partner in industrial development and promotion of industrial enterprises both as a matter of national policy and to ensure public control over certain sectors of the economy.In India, the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 has laid down the basic principle that will govern the state’s approach towards industrial development t. The approach derives its base from the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in the Constitution and from the adoption by Parliament in December 1954 of the socialist pattern of society as the objective o four social and economic goals and laws. The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 stated that the need for rapid planned development required that all industries of basic and strategic importance, or in the nature of public utility services, should be in the public sector.Consequently, their number has steadily increased with every plan, and by the end of Third Plan period, various State governments owned or held majority shares in about 175 Public Undertakings, with an estimated total investment of nearly Rs. 2,000 crores.Public enterprises in our country cover a range of activities that is at once vast and varied. They are engaged:•  directly or indirectly in advancing loans;•  regulating trade;•  organizing promotional land development activities;•  manufacturing heavy machinery, machine tool;•  instruments, electrical equipment, chemicals, drugs and•  •  •  •  • fertilizers;prospecting and drilling for oil laden refining crude oil; operating air, sea land road transport;mining of coal and mineral ores;smelting and casing of steel and other metals;production and distribution of mills, trading, markets, hotels,etc. Module – 1160
A public undertaking, for purposes of examination by the Estimates Committee, was defined by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha as follows,“Public Undertaking means an organization endowed with a legal personality and set up by or under the provisions of a statute for undertaking on behalf of the government of India an enterprise of industrial, commercial nature or special services in the public interest and possessing a large measures of administrative and financial autonomy.”This definition obviously is concerned only with the public undertakings under the union Government and leaves out of account public undertakings in the States. A more comprehensive definition has been given by S. S. Khera,“By State economic activity carried on by the central government or by a state government or jointly by the central government and state government, and a in each either solely or in association with private enterprise so long as it is managed by a self-contained management.”S. S. Khera gives six good reasons to justify the Government’s playing an active role in economic development:i) Modern economy has to be a planned economy, and it has come to be widely recognized and the prejudice against it is fast dying out even in the so- called capitalist or free-economy countries. Planning is of particular significance to an under-developed country like India, where a lot has to be achieved with limited resources and within a limited time. Modern planned economy has, thus, become inevitable; and in a planned economy, the national responsibility of planning is something that cannot be assumed or discharged by any authority other than the Government, which the people have elected to office to look after the affairs of the country.ii) In a country like India where the industrial base has not been built up sufficiently, and the capital investment funds still need a great deal of building up and garnering, state intervention becomes imperative.iii) Government, such as, the present Government in India, which is committed to the objective of a socialist society, is increasingly compelled to enter directly into industrial and commercial activity.iv) A Government politically committed to certain-social objective, may well decide that in order to achieve certain minimum per capita income it may be necessary to set up, to evolve and to operate a pattern of prices, subsidies, incentives or disincentives of different kinds in order to influence the consumption pattern.Module – 1   161
v) By active participation in business; the Government has sought to tap gold mines of industry and commerce for the funds needed to discharge the new and heavier burdens it now shoulders.vi) Large-scale participation by government in industrial and commercial activity is bound to augment the national dividend.Organization of Public Undertakings.There is no one ideal form of organizing public enterprisesIn general, three main forms of organization, each with significant variations, are now utilized for the administration of public enterprises, namely Departmental Concerns, Government Companies and Public Corporations.1.Departmental Concerns. Initially, no distinction was drawn between public enterprises and traditional government functions. Thus, the oldest state enterprises, such ass the postal, telegraph and telephone service, and railways were organized financed and controlled as any other government department. This form of organization is still commonly employed when the main purpose of the enterprise is to provide revenue.Government companies. The Joint-Stock Company form has been used extensively in recent years in respect of manufacturing activities in the public sector. Both, the Central and the State Governments seem to favor it. This type is also known as mixed ownership companies. It should be remembered that the form does not describe a legal or organizational pattern but an economic concept. It includes various forms of joint enterprises shared between the State and private enterprises. The latter may be national or foreign. They may represent the shares of individual firms participating in the venture or the subscription of members of the public at large.2.According to the Report of the Study Team on Public Sector Undertakings (of the Administrative Reforms Commission) central and provincial characteristics of this form are as follows;a) It has most of the features of a private limited company; Module – 1 162
b)c)d)e)f)The whole of the capital stock or 51 per cent or above of it, is owned by the Government;All the directors, or a majority of them, are appointed by the Government depending upon the extent to which private capital is participating in the enterprise;It is a body corporate, created under a general law, viz., the Companies Act;It can sue and be sued, enter into contract, and acquire property in its own name;Unlike the public corporation, it is created by an executive decision of the Government without Parliament’s specific approval having been obtained, and its Articles of association, though conforming to an Act are drawn up and are revisable by the government;g) Its funds are obtained from the Government and, in some cases, from private shareholders, and through revenues derived from sale of its goods and services;h)i)3.It is generally exempt from the personnel, budget, accounting and audit laws and procedures applicable to Government departments; andIts employees, excluding the deputations, are not civil servants.Public Corporations. During the last 40 years or so, a new form of organization for managing public enterprises has been evolved in the shape of public corporation, which has been described by W. A. Robson as “The most important constitutional innovation of this century.” The principal characteristics of the Public Corporation, according to the Rangoon Seminar Report, are as follows;It is wholly owned by the State.i) Module – 1163
ii)iii)It is generally created by, or pursuant to, a special law defining its powers, duties and immunities and prescribing the form of management and its relation to established departments and ministries.As a body corporate, it is a separate entity for legal purposes and can sue and be sued, enter into contracts and acquire property its own name. Corporations conducting business in their own names have been generally given greater freedom in making contracts and acquiring and disposing of property in its own name. Corporations conducting business in their own names have been generally given greater freedom in making contracts and acquiring and disposing of property than ordinary government departments.Except for government appropriations to provide capital or a to cover losses, a public its funds from borrowing either from the Treasury or the public, or from revenues derived from the sale of goods and services. It is authorized to use and re-use its revenues.It is generally exempted from most regulatory and prohibitory statues applicable to expenditure of public funds.It is ordinarily not subject to the budget, accounting and audit laws, and procedures applicable to non-corporate agencies.In the majority of cases, employees of Public Corporations are not civil servants, and are recruited and remunerated under terms and conditions which the Corporation itself determines.iv)v)vi)vii)In view ofcorporations are treated both as public authorities and as commercial concerns.the above discussion it becomes clear that these publicThe principal benefits of the Public Corporation as an organizational device are its freedom from unsuitable government regulations and controls and its high degree of operating and financial flexibility. In this form, one discerns a balance between the auto my and flexibility enjoyed by private enterprise and the responsibility of the public as represented by elected members and legislators.Module – 1   164
In the famous word so president Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Public Corporation“Is clothed with the power of government but possessed of the flexibility and initiative of a private enterprise.”However, this form, in its turn, has given rise to other problems, namely the difficulty of reconciling autonomy of the corporation with public accountability. That the Public Corporations cannot be made immune from ministerial control land direction is universally conceded. But how to do it without infringing their corporate autonomy has come into direct conflict with the urgent need for bringing the operations of this Corporation into harmony with related actions of the government. Vacuum Removal from the so-called political pressures may mean, in fact, that the significant political power is being placed in the hands of a small unrepresentative, and in extreme cases, possibly even a self-perpetuating group controlling the Public Corporations.To sum up, each of these three types of organization has its own strong and weak points. Thus, A. D. Gorwala has held the views that the departmental management was in many ways a direct negation of the requirements of autonomy and militated against flexibility and initiative, that is sound “State enterprise tradition” It must, therefore, be a rare exception to be resorted to when dictated by the need of secrecy, strategic importance, etc. He, generally, favored the Company form for substantially commercial functions because of great flexibility. According to him, Corporation form should be used when the undertaking was to discharge what in effect were the extensions of government functions, for example, broadcasting, irrigation, etc.According to the administrative Reforms Commission’s Study Team Report, among all the three forms in which public undertakings have been organized, the Departmental form is one that is generally regarded suitable only for undertakings that provide services affecting the totality of the community or the security of the country. A Departmental form cannot provide the flexibility and autonomy that are needed for commercial and industrial enterprise. Such undertakings require a high degree of freedom, boldness and enterprise in management and must be free from the circumspection and cumbersome, time consuming and vexatious procedures of departmental administration. Both the Company form and the Public Corporation form can provide for this flexibility and autonomy. It is not, therefore, all types of understandings and under all circumstances. The choice will have to depend on the nature of the undertakings, its importance, its magnitude and investment, and the role that it is expected to play in economic development, capital formation and provision of goods and services. What is crucial is the vigilance and responsibility with which autonomy is exercised and the meticulousness and spirit of co-operation with which autonomy is respected.Some Problems for Public Corporation. Public Corporation has succeeded in solving a number of problems. At the same time, however, it has createdModule – 1   165
some others. Some of the more pressing problems confronting the Public Corporations are:(c) Should there are a Standing Parliamentary Committee on public Corporations?The supreme considerations underlying the choice of Public Corporations in preference to other forms of state enterprises are autonomy of the Corporations must be scrupulously honored; the latter cannot be made wholly free from responsibility to Parliament or from ministerial control. They are accountable to Parliament at least on those matters, which lie under the control, direct or indirect, of the Minister. Parliaments certainly entitled to discuss the general policies of the Public Corporations, and the economy and efficiency of their administration. It should not, however, discuss day-to-day matters and details of administration. The need for reconciling autonomy of the Corporations with the accountability to Parliament has been repeatedly emphasized . These public corporation are treated both a public authorities and as commercial concerns. As public authorities they are subject to the normal controls of constitution and administrative laws to supervision by the minister, who in turn is answerable to Parliament, and by Courts through the control, which they exercise over administrative authorities.The test for determining the constitutional position of a Public Corporation as either a Department of Government or as a servant of the State may be summarized as below: (a) How should we reconcile autonomy of the Public Corporations with public accountability, i.e., accountability to Parliament?(b) What should be the extent and nature of ministerial control?i)ii)If the statute in terms answers the question (as it did in the case of the Central Land Board under the Company & Town Planning Act, 1917), the need for any further enquiry s obviated.In the absence of such statutory declaration or provision, the intention of Parliament as to be gathered from the provisions of the statute constituting the Corporation.Some Attributes of Public Corporation Module – 1 166
• •  • • • Vicarious Liability a Corporation. On principles of vicarious liability, corporation is liable to pay damages for wrongs done by their officers or servants. They are liable even for tort requiring a mental element as an ingredient, e.g. malicious prosecution. In India, local authorities like Municipalities and District Boards have been held responsible for the tort committed by their servants or officers.Grant of exemption to government companies from the application of a statutory provision does not fall foul of Art. 14 and is not discriminatory as government companies stand in a different class altogether and the classification made between government companies and others is a valid one. The Supreme Court has advanced the following justification for this view.“As far as Government undertakings and companies are concerned, it has to be held that they form a class by themselves since any profit that they may make would in the end result to the benefit to the members of the general public... The role of industries in the public sector is very sensitive and critical from the point of view of national economy...”The public corporation (statutory corporation) is a body having an entity separate and independent from the Government. It is not a department or organ of the Government. Consequently, its employees are not regarded as Government servants and therefore they are not entitled to the protection of Article 311.A public corporation is a person but not citizen. And therefore it can claim the benefit of the Fundamental Rights.It is to be also noted that a public corporation is included within the meaning of State under Article12. and therefore the Fundamental right can be enforced against itThe public corporation or statutory corporations are included with the meaning of other authorities and therefore it is subject•  Module – 1167
• •  • to the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 32 and of the High Court under Article 226.For the validity of the corporation contract, the requirements of a valid contract laid down in Article 299 are not required to be complied with.The employees of a public corporation are subject to the labour laws.The Government control over the financial matters relating to the public corporation provides teeth to the governmental control of the public corporations. Generally the Government is vested with the powers of controlling the borrowing expenditure and capital formation. For example, the Oil and Natural Gas Commission Act, 1956 provides that the Commission can borrow money with the prior approval of the Central Government. Similarly, the Damodar Valley Corporation Act provides that the Corporation can borrow money with the prior approval of the Central Government. The statute creating the corporation may require the corporation to submit to the Government its budget and programme for the next year.To sum up we can say that public enterprise in the near future will be subjected to the scrutiny of the consumers and Courts. Because the quality of services rendered by these enterprises to the public is a matter, which concerns consumers in many ways. It is but natural, therefore, that disputes arises between the enterprises and their employees, or between the enterprises and the public also, the courts are not averse to extending their supervisory role over these enterprises in some respects.The Supreme Court has recently underlined the principle of public accountability of these enterprises (with reference to the life Insurance Corporation) in the following words:“ Corporation which carries on the business of life insurance in the shape of a statutory monopoly is answerable to the people of India with whose funds it deals and to whose welfare it clams to cater. Module – 1 168
 Suits against the Administration: State LiabilityActions of the administration. These remedies help in preventing the recurrence the extraordinary legal remedies that is available to the individual against the illegal of an illegality. However, they do not provide full redress to the aggrieved individual. Private citizens access to the ordinary courts and the ordinary legal remedies may be qualified by the existence of certain privileges and immunities enjoyed by the state. These privileges immunities though justified in the days in which they originated, are hardly justified in a democratic society. However, the state does enjoy and it may be necessary for it to enjoy certain privileges and immunities. Administrative law is engaged in the process of redefining such privileges and immunities with a view to reconciling them with the needs of modern times.The Constitution clearly says that the executive power of the Union and of each state extends to ‘the carrying on for any trade or business and to the acquisition, holding and disposal of property and the making of contracts for any purpose’. The Constitution therefore, provides that a Government may sue or may be sued by its name. Similar provisions to be found in the Code of Civil Procedure. The above provisions do not, however, enlarge or restrict the extent of State liability; they merely provide the method of redress. The extent of liability will be discussed separately.Privileges and Immunities of the Administration in SuitsThe various privileges available to the Government under various statutes are as follows: - I.Immunities from the operation of the statute.In England the rule is that its own laws do not bind the Crown unless by express provision or by necessary implication they are made binding on it. Thus in England the statutes are not binding on the crown unless by express provision or by necessary implication, they are made binding thereon. Its basis is the maxim “ the King can do on wrong. This rule was followed even in India till 1967.In India the present position is that the statute binds the State or Government unless expressly or by necessary implication it has exempted or excluded from its operation. In case the State has been exempted from the operation of the statute expressly, there is no difficulty in ascertaining whether the statute is binding on the State or not but it becomes a difficult issue in case where the State is exempted from the operation of the statute by necessary implication. However,Module – 1   169
where the statute provides for criminal prosecution involving imprisonment, the statute is deemed to be excluded from the operation of the statute necessary implication.II. Privileges and Immunities under the Civil Procedure Code, 1908.Section 80 (1) provides that no suit shall be instituted against the Government or against a public officer in respect of any act purporting to be done by such public officer in his official capacity, until the expiration of two months next after notice in writing has been delivered in the manner provided in the section. The section is mandatory and admits of no exception. Thus, the requirement of notice is mandatory. However, it is to be noted that if a public officer acts without jurisdiction, the requirement of notice is not mandatory. Its object appears to provide the Government or the public officer an opportunity to consider the legal position thereon and settle the claim without litigation.The Government may waive the requirement of notice; the waiver may be express or implied.The requirement of notice causes much inconvenience to the litigants especially when they seek immediate relief against the Government.To minimize the hardships to the litigants a new Clause (20 was inserted in S.80 of the C.P.C by the Civil Procedure Code Amendment Act, 1970. The clause provides that the Court may grant leave to a person to file a suit against the Government or a public officer without serving the two-month’s notice in case where relief claimed is immediate and urgent. Before granting this exemption the Court is required to satisfy itself about the immediate and urgent need.It is to be noted that S.80 of the C.P.C does not apply to a suit against a statutory Corporation. Consequently in case the suit is filed against the statutory Corporation. Consequently, such notice is not required to be given in cases the suit is filed against statutory Corporation.S.80 does not apply with respect to a claim against the Government before the claim Tribunal under the Motor Vehicle Act.S.80 of the C.P.C. does not apply to a writ petition against the Government or a public officer, the requirement of notice as provided under S.80 of the C.P.C is not required to be complied with.S.82 of the C.P.C. also provide privilege to the Government. According to this section where in a suit by or against the Government or the public officer, a time shall be specified in the decreed within which shall be satisfied and if the decree is not satisfied writhing the time so specified and within three months from the date of the decree. Where no time is so specified, the Court shall report the case fro the orders of the Government,. Thus a decree against the Government or a public         Module – 1   170
officer is not executable immediately. The Court is required to specify the time within which the decree has to be satisfied and where no such time has been specified, three moths from the date of the decree will be taken to be the time within which is to be satisfied. If the decree is not satisfied within such time limit the Court shall report the case for the orders of the Government.III. Privileges under the Evidence Act (Privileges to withhold documents).In England the Crown enjoys the privilege to withhold from producing a document before the Court in case the disclosure thereof is likely to jeopardize the public interest. In Duncon v. Cammel Laird Co. Ltd. ( 1942 AC 624)The Court held that the Crown is the sole judge to decide whether a document is a privileged one and the court cannot review the decision of the Crown. However, this decision has been overruled in the case of Conway v. Rimmer. ( 1968 AC 910) In this case the Court has held that it is not an absolute privilege of the Crown to decide whether a document is a privileged one. The court can see it and decide whether it is a privileged one or not.In India S. 123 provides that no one shall be permitted to give any evidence derived from unpublished official records relating to any affair of State except with the permission of the officer at the Head thinks fit. Only those records relating to the affairs of the State are privileged, the disclosure of which would cause injury to the public interest. To claim this immunity the document must relate to affairs of state and disclosure thereof must be against interest of the State or public service and interest.The section is based on the principle that the disclosure of the document in question would cause injury to the public interest And that in case of conflict between the public interest and the private interest, the private interest must yield to the public interest.The Court has power to decide as to whether such communication has been made to the officer in official confidence. For the application of S.124 the communication is required to have made to a public officer in official confidence and the public officer must consider that the disclosure of the communication will cause injury to the public interest.According to S.162 a witness summoned to provide a document shall, if it is in his possession or power, bring it to the Court, not with outstanding any objective which there may be to its production or to its admissibility. The Court shall decide on the validity of any such objection. The court, if it sees fit, may inspect the document, unless it refers to the matters of State or take other evidence to enable it to determine on its admissibility. If for such purpose it is necessary to cause any document to be translated the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the translator to keep the contents secret, unless the direction,Module – 1   171
he shall be held to have committed an offence under S.166 of the Indian Penal Code.S. 162 apply not only to the official documents but also to the private documents.It is for the Court to decide as to whether a document is or is not a record relating to the affairs of the State. For this purpose the Court can take evidence and may inspect the document itself.In State of Punjab v. Sodhi Sukdev Singh ( AIR 1961 SC 493) the court had the opportunity of discussing the extent of government privilege to withhold documents where twin claims of governmental confidentiality and individual justice compete for recognition.The court was very alive to the constraints of this privilege on private defense, therefore Gajendragadkar, J. delivering the majority judgment cautioned that care has to be taken to see that interests other than that of the public do not masquerade in the garb of public interest and take undue advantage of the provision of Section 123. In order to guard against the possible misuse of the privilege, the court also developed certain norms. First, the claim of privilege should be in the form of an affidavit, which must be signed by the Minister concerned, or the Secretary of the Department. Second, the affidavit must indicate within permissible limits the reasons why the disclosure would result in public injury, and that the document in question has been carefully read and considered and the authority is fully convinced that its disclosure would injure public interest. Third, the if the affidavit is found unsatisfactory, the court may summon the authority for cross-examination.Working the formulations still further, the court in Amar Chand v. Union of India (AIR 1964 SC 1658) disallowed the privilege where there was evidence to show that the authority did not apply its mind to the question of injury to the public interest which would be caused by the disclosure of the document. In Indira Nehru Gandh v. Raj Narain .(1975 Supp SCC 1: AIR 1975 SC 2299) the Court compelled the production of Blue Books of the polic and disallowed the claims of privilege. In State of Orissa v. Jagannath Jena, ((1972) 2 SCC 165) the Supreme Court again disallowed the privilege on the ground that the public interest aspect had not been clearly brought out in the affidavit. In this case, the plaintiff wanted to see endorsement on a file by the Deputy Chief Minister and the I. G. of Police.The law on Government privileges took a new turn in S.P. Gupta v. Union of India ( AIR 1982 SC 149) The question in the present case was whether the correspondence between the Law Minister and these Chief Justices ought to be produced in the Supreme Court, so, as to enable the court to judge the question of validity of the non-continuance of anModule – 1   172
Additional Judge in the Delhi High Court. The government opposed the production of these reports on the ground that their disclosure would injure public interest under Section 123 of the Indian Evidence act. But the Supreme Court ruled otherwise. The case is a definite evidence of court’s attempt to promote the ideal of open Government in India.Justice Bhagwati took some such view in the above case when he expressed his faith in the ideal of an open Government. Merely secrecy of the Government is not a vital public interest so as to prevail over the most imperative demands of justice.In giving a new orientation to the statutory provision in question, Bhagwati, J. emphasized, “Where a society has chosen to accept democracy as its creedal faith, it is elementary that the citizens ought to know what their Government is doing.” He observed: “The citizen’s right to know the facts, the true facts, about the administration of the country is thus one of the pillars of a democratic state. And this is why the demand for openness in the Government is increasingly growing in different parts of the world.”He further pointed out that if the process and functioning of Government are kept shrouded in secrecy and hidden from public scrutiny, it would tend to promote and encourage oppression, corruption and misuse or abuse of authority.The decision has opened a new dimension of judicial control over the exercise of privileges under Sections 123 by the executive. The Court now has assumed the power of inspection of documents in camera and if it finds that its disclosure would harm the public interest, the claim for non-disclosure might be upheld. If the disclosure, to the mind of the Court, does not harm the public interest, its disclosure would be ordered.Period of Limitation for Suit Against GovernmentArt 149 of the First Schedule of the Limitation Act of 1890 prescribed a longer period of limitation for suits by or on behalf of the State. The Act of 1963 contains a similar provision under Art 112. The Article applies to the Central Government an all the State Governments including the Government of the State of Jammu land Kashmir. This longer limitation period was based on the common law maxim nulla tempus occur it rein, that is, no time affects the Crown.The longer period of limitation, however, does not apply to appeals and applications by Government.Module – 1   173
Under s 5 of the Limitation Act, it is provided that an appeal or application may be admitted after the expiry of the period of limitation if the court is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for the delay. It was held that the government was not entitled to any special consideration in the matter of condo nation of delay.Immunity from Promissory EstoppelEstoppel is a rule whereby a party is precluded from denying the existence of some state of facts, which he had previously asserted and on which the other party has relied or is entitled to rely on. Courts, on the principle of equity, to avoid injustice, have evolved the doctrine of promissory estoppels.The doctrine of promissory estoppel or equitable estoppel is firmly established in administrative law. The doctrine represents a principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice. Application of the doctrine against government is well established particularly where it is necessary to prevent manifest injustice to any individual.The doctrine of promissory estoppel against the Government also in exercise of its Government, public or executive functions, where it is necessary to prevent fraud or manifest injustice. The doctrine within the aforesaid limitations cannot be defeated on the plea of the executive necessity or freedom of future executive action.The doctrine cannot, however, be pressed into aid to compel the Government or the public authority “to carry out a representation or promise.a) which is contrary of law; orb) which is outside the authority or power of the Officer of theGovernment or of the public authority to make.”It is to be noted that Estoppel cannot be pleaded against a minor or against statute. Estoppel does not lie against the Government on the representation or Statement of facts under S. 115 if it is against the statute or Act of the Legislature but it may be applied in irregular act. The liability of the Government has been extended by the doctrine of Promissory Estoppel.Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel is often applied to make the Government liable for its promises and stopped from going back from the promise made by it. According to this doctrine where a person by words or conduct and the other person acts on such promise or assurance andModule – 1   174
changes his positive to his detriment, the person who gives such promise or assurance cannot be allowed to revert or deviate from the promise.Case lawIn India, the courts are invoking this doctrine,In Union of India v. Anglo (Indo) – Afghan Agencies Ltd.,(AIR 1968 SC 718)The doctrine of Promissory Estoppel was applied against the Government. This case developed a new judicial trend. The Court upheld the application of Promissory Estoppel to the executive acts of the State. The Court negated the plea of executive necessity. Under the scheme an exporter was entitled to import raw materials equal to the amount, which was exported. Five lakhs rupees worth goods were exported by the petitioner but he was given import license for an amount below two lakh rupees. The Court held that the Government was bound to keep its promise. The scheme was held to be binding on the Government and the petitioner was entitled to get the benefit of the scheme.The Supreme Court in Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. V. Ulhasnagar Municipal Council,(AIR 1971 SC 1021)again extended the doctrine of Promissory Estoppel. In this case this doctrine was applied against public authorities. The Court has made it clear that this Court will not make a distinction between a private individual and a public body so far as the doctrine of Promissory Estoppel is concerned.In short, if the Government makes a promise and promisee acts upon it and changes his position, then the Government will be held bound by the promise and cannot change its position against the promisee and it is not necessary for the promisee to further show that he has acted to his detriment. For the application of the doctrine of Promissory Estoppel it is not necessary that there should be some pre-existing contractual relationship between the parties.In Delhi Cloth and General Mills v. Union of India, (1988 1 S.C.C. 86 ) the Supreme Court has held that for the application of the principle of Promissory Estoppel change in position by acting on the assurance to the promise is not required to be proved.However, the judicial opinion is that it cannot be invoked against a statutory provision or to support an ultra vires act or to compel the Government or a public authority to carry out a promise, which is contrary to law, or ultra vires its powers.The doctrine of Promissory Estoppel is not applied in the following conditions:1. Public Interest : The doctrine of Promissory Estoppel is an equitable doctrine and therefore it must yield place to the equity if larger public interest requires. It would not be enough to say that the publicModule – 1   175
interest requires that the Government would suffer if the Government were required to honor it. In order to resist its liability the Government would disclose to the Court the various event insisting its claim to be exempt from liability and it would be for the Court to decide whether those events are such as to render it equitable and to enforce the liability against the Government.2. Representation against law: The doctrine of Promissory Estoppel cannot be applied so as compel the Government or the public authority to carry out a promise, which does law prohibit.3. Ultra vires promise or representation: If the promise or representation made by the officer is beyond his power, the State cannot be held liable for it one the basis of the Principle of Promissory Estoppel.4. Fraud : the doctrine of Promissory Estoppel is not applied in cases where the promise from the Government is obtained by fraud.5. Fraud on the Constitution: The doctrine of Promissory Estoppel is not applied in cases when the promise or representation is obtained to play fraud on the Constitution and enforcement would defeat or tend to defeat the Constitutional goal.Liability of State or Government in ContractArticle 298 provides that the executive power of the Union and of each State shall extend to the carrying on of any trade or business and to the acquisition holding and disposal property and the making of contracts for any purpose. Article 299 (I) lays down the manner of formulation of such contract. Article 299 provides that all contracts in the exercise of the executive power of the union or of a State shall be expressed to be made by the President or by the Governor of the State, as the case may be, and all such contracts and all assurances of property made in the exercise of that power shall be executed on behalf of the President or the Governor by such persons and in such manner as he may direct or authorize. Article 299 (2) makes it clear that neither the President nor the Governor Shall be personally liable in respect of any contract or assurance made or executed for the purposes of this Constitution or for the purposes of any enactment relating or executing any such contract or assurance on behalf of any of them be personally liable in respect thereof. Subject to the provisions of Article 299 (1), the other provisions of the general law of contract apply even to the Government contract.A contract with the Government of the Union or State will be valid and binding only if the following conditions are followed: - Module – 1176
1.2.3.The contract with the Government will not be binding if it is not expressed to be made in the name of the President or the Governor, as the case may be.The contract must be executed on behalf of the President or the Governor of the State as the case may be. The word executed indicates that a contract with the Government will be valid only when it is in writing.A person duly authorized by the President or the Governor of the State, as the case may be, must execute the contract.The above provisions of Article 299 are mandatory and the contract made in contravention thereof is void and unenforceable.The Supreme Court has made it clear that in the case grant of Government contract the Court should not interfere unless substantial public interest is involved or grant is mala fide when a writ petition is filed in the High Court challenging the award of a contract by a public authority or the State, the Court must be satisfied that there is some element of public interest involved in entertaining such a petition.Effect of a valid contract with GovernmentHowever, as Article 299 (2) provides neither the President nor the Governor shall be personally liable in respect of any contract or assurance made or executed for the purposes of this Constitution or for the purposes of any enactment relating to the Government of India. As soon as a contract is executed with the Government in accordance with Article 299, the whole law of contract as contained in the Indian Contract Act comes into operations. Thus the applications of the private law of contract in the area of public contracts may result in the cases of injustice.A contract of service with the Governments not covered by Article 299 ofthe Constitution. After a person is taken in a service under theGovernment, his rights and obligations are governed by the statutoryrules framed by the Government and not by the contract of the parties.Service contracts with the Government do not come within the scope ofArticle 299. They are subject to “pleasure”. They are not contracts inusual sense of the term as they can be determined at will despite anexpress condition to the contrary. (See Parshottam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India, AIR 1958 SC 36)In India the remedy for the branch of a contract with Government is simply a suit for damages. The writ of mandamus could not be issued for the enforcement of contractual obligations. But the Supreme Court in its pronouncement in Gujarat State Financial Corporation v. Lotus Hotels, ((1983) 3 SCC 379) has taken a new stand and held that the writ of mandamusModule – 1   177
can be issued against the Government or its instrumentality for the enforcement of contractual obligations. The Court ruled that it is too late to contend today the Government can commit branch of a solemn undertaking on which other side has acted and then contend that the party suffering by the branch of contract may sue for damages and cannot compel specific performance of the contract through mandamus.The doctrine of judicial review has extended to the contracts entered into by the State of its instrumentality with any person. Before the case of Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority. (AIR 1979 SC 1628) The attitude of the Court was in favour of the view that the Government has freedom to deal with any one it chooses and if one person is chosen rather than another, the aggrieved party cannot claim the protection of article 14 because the choice of the person to fulfill a particular contract must be left to the Government, However, there has been significant change in the Court’s attitude after the case of Ramana Dayaram Shetty. The attitude for the Court appears to be in favour of the view that the Government does not enjoy absolute discretion to enter into contract with any one it likes. They are bound to act reasonably fairly and in non-discriminatory manner.In the case of Kasturi Lal v. State of J&K (AIR 1980 SC 1992), in this case Justice Bhagwati has said “Every activity of the Government has a public element in it and it must, therefore, be informed with reason and guided by public interest. Every government cannot act arbitrarily without reason and if it does, its action would be liable to be invalidated.” Non- arbitrariness, fairness in action and due consideration of legitimate expectation of affected party are essential requisites for a valid state action. (Food Corporation of India v. Kamadhenu Cattle Feed Industries, (1993) 1 SCC 71) In a recent case (Tata Cellular v. Union of India, AIR 1996 SC 11) the Supreme Court has held that the right to refuse the lowest or any other tender is always available to the Government but the principles laid down in Article 14 of the Constitution have to be kept in view while accepting or refusing a tender. There can be no question of infringement of Article 14 if the Government tries to get the best person or the best quotation. The right to choose cannot be considered to be an arbitrary power. Of course, if the said power is exercised fro any collateral purpose the exercise of that power will be struck down.Ratification: -The present position is that the contract made in contravention of the provisions of Article 299 (1) shall be void and therefore cannot be ratified.The Supreme Court has made it clear that the provisions of Article 299 (1) are mandatory and therefore the contract made in contravention thereof is void and therefore cannot be ratified and cannot be enforced even by invoking the doctrine of Estoppel. In such condition the questionModule – 1   178
of estoppel does not arise. The part to such contract cannot be estoppel from questioning the validity of the contract because there cannot be estoppel against the mandatory requirement of Article 299.The Government cannot exercise its power arbitrarily or capriciously or in an unprincipled manner. In this case Justice Bhagwati has said “ Every activity of the Government has a public element in it and it must therefore, be informed with reason and guided by public interest: Government cannot act arbitrarily and without reason and if it does, its action due consideration of legitimate expectation of affected party are Court has held that the right to refuse the lowest or any other tender is always available to the Government but the principles laid down in article 14 of the Constitution have to be kept in view while accepting or refusing a tender. The right to choose cannot be considered to be an arbitrary power. Of Course, if the said power is exercised for any collateral purpose the exercise of that power will be struck down.In the case of Shrilekha Vidyarathi v. State of U.P (1991 S.C .C 212) the Supreme Court has made it clear that the State has to act justly, fairly and reasonably even in contractual field. In the case of contractual actions of the State the public element is always present so as to attract article 14. State acts for public good and in public interest and its public character does not change merely because the statutory or contractual rights are also available to the other party. The court has held that the state action is public in nature and therefore it is open to the judicial review even if it pertains to the contractual field. Thus the contractual action of the state may be questioned as arbitrary in proceedings under Article 32 or 226 of the Constitution. It is to be noted that the provisions of Sections 73, 74 and 75 of the Indian Contract Act dealing with the determination of the quantum of damages in the case of breach of contract also applies in the case of Government contract.Quasi-Contractual LiabilityAccording to section 70 where a person lawfully does anything for another person or delivers anything to him such other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of or to restore, the thing so done or delivered. If the requirements of Section 70 of the Indian Contract act are fulfilled, even the Government will be liable to pay compensation for the work actually done or services rendered by the State.Section 70 is not based on any subsisting contract between the parties but is based on quasi-contract or restitution. Section 70 enables a person who actually supplies goods or renders some services not intending to do gratuitously, to claim compensation from the person who enjoys the benefit of the supply made or services rendered. It is a liability, which arise on equitable grounds even though express agreement or contract may not be proved.Section 65 of the Indian Contract Act. Module – 1 179
If the agreement with the Government is void as the requirement of Article 299 (1) have not been complied, the party receiving the advantage under such agreement is bound to restore it or to make compensation for it to the person form whom he has received it. Thus if a contractor enters into agreement with the Government for the construction of go down and received payment therefore and the agreement is found to be void as the requirements of Article 299 (1) have not been complied with, the Government can recover the amount advanced to the contractor under Section 65 of the Indian Contract act. Action 65 provides that when an agreement is discovered to be void or when a contract becomes void, any person who has received any advantage under such agreement or contract is bound to restore it to make compensation for it to the person from whom he received it.Suit against State in tortsBefore discussing tortuous liability, it will be desirable to know the meaning of ‘tort’. A tort is a civil wrong arising out of breach of a civil duty or breach of non-contractual obligation. The word ‘tort’ has been defined in Chambers Dictionary in the following words;“Tort is any wrong or injury not arising out of contact for which there is remedy by compensation or damages.”Thus, tort is a civil wrong, which arises either out of breach of no contractual obligation or out of a breach of civil duty. In other words, tort is a civil wrong the only remedy for which is damages. The essential requirement for the arising of the tort is the beach of duty towards people in general. Although tort is a civil wrong, yet it would be wrong to think that all civil wrongs are torts. A civil wrong which arises out for the breach of contact cannot be put in the category of tort as it is different from a civil wrong arising out of the breach of duty towards public in general.Liability for TortsIn India immunity of the Government for the tortious acts of its servants, based on the remnants of old feudalistic notion that the king cannot be sued I his own courts without his consent ever existed. The doctrine of sovereign immunity, a common law rule, which existed in England, also found place in the United States before 1946 Mr. Justice Holmes in 1907 declared for a unanimous Supreme Court:“A sovereign is exempt from suit not because of any formal conception or obsolete theory, but on the logical and practical  Module – 1 180
ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends.”Today, hardly, anyone agrees that the stated ground for exempting the sovereign from suit is either logical or practical.Vicarious Liability of the StateWhen the responsibility of the act of one person falls on another person, it is called vicarious liability. Such type of liabilities is very common. For example, when the servant of a person harms another person through his act, we held the servant as well as his master liable for the act done by the servant.Here what we mean is essentially the vicarious liability of the State for the torts committed by its servants in the exercise of their duty. The State would of course not be liable if the acts done were necessary for protection life or property. Acts such as judicial or quasi-judicial decisions done in good faith would not invite any liability. There are specific statutory provisions which the administrative authorities from liability. Such protection, however, would not extent malicious act. The burden of proving that an act was malicious would lie on the person who assails the administrative action. The principles of law of torts would apply in the determination of what is a tort and all the defences available to the respondent in a suit for tort would be available to the public servant also. If after all this, a public servant is proved to have been guilty of a tort like negligence, should the State, as his employer is liable?In India Article 300 declares that the Government of India or a of a State may be sued for the tortious acts of its servants in the same manner as the Dominion of India and the corresponding provinces could have been sued or have been sued before the commencement of the present Constitution. This rule is, however, subject to any such law made by the Parliament or the State Legislature.Case Law on the tortious liability of the StateThe first important case involving the tortious liability of the Secretary of State for India-in –Council was raised in P.and O. Steam Navigation v. Secretary of State for India. (5 Bom HCR App 1.)The question referred to the Supreme Court was whether the Secretary of State for India is liable for the damages caused by the negligence of the servants in the service of the Government. The Supreme Court delivered a very learned judgment through Chief Justice Peacock, and answered the question in the affirmative. The Court pointed out the principle of law Module – 1   181
that the Secretary of State for India in Council is liable for the damages occasioned by the negligence of Government servants, if the negligence is such as would render an ordinary employer liable. According to the principle laid down in this case the Secretary of State can be liable only for acts of non sovereign nature, liability will not accrue for sovereign acts Chief Justice peacock admitted the distinction between the sovereign and non sovereign functions of the government and said:“There is a great and clear distinction between acts done in exercise of what are termed sovereign powers, and acts done in the conduct of undertakings which might be carried on by private individuals without having such powers delegated to them.”But the judgment of P. and O. Steam Navigation case, was differently interpreted in Secretary of State v. Hari Bhanji, (5 Mad 273) In this case it was held that if claims do not arise out of acts of State, the civil Courts could entertain them.Module – 1   182
The conflicting position before the commencement of the Constitution has been set at rest in the well known judgment of the Supreme Court in State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati, (AIR 1962 SC 933) where the driver of a jeep, owned and maintained by the State of Rajasthan for the official use of the Collector of the district, drove it rashly and negligently while taking it back from the workshop to the residence of the Collector after repairs, and knocked down a pedestrian and fatally injured him. The State was sued for damages. The Supreme Court held that the State was vicariously liable for damages caused by the negligence of the driver. in fact, the decision of the Supreme Court in State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati, (Kesoram Poddar v. Secretary of State for India, 54 Cal 969) introduces an important qualification on the State immunity in tort based on the doctrines of sovereign and non sovereign functions. It decided that the immunity for State action can only be claimed if the act in question was done in the course of the exercise of sovereign functions.Then came the important case of Kasturi Lal v. State of U. P. (AIR 1965 SC 1039) where the Government was not held liable for the tort committed by its servant because the tort was said to have been committed by him in the course of the discharge of statutory duties. The statutory functions imposed on the employee were referable to and ultimately based on the delegation of the sovereign powers of the State.The Court held that the Government was not liable as the activity involved was a sovereign activity. The Court affirmed the distinction between sovereign and non-sovereign function drawn in the P. and O. Steam Navigation’s case in the following terms.The Supreme Court’s judgment unambiguously indicates that the Court itself on the question of justice felt strongly that Kashturilal should be compensated yet, as a matter of law they held that he could not be.There are, on the other hand, a good number of cases where the courts, although have maintained the distinction between sovereign and non- sovereign functions yet in practice have transformed their attitude holding most of the functions of the government as non-sovereign. Consequently there has been an expansion in the area of governmental liability in torts. Sovereign and non-sovereign dichotomy Changed judicial attitudeModule – 1   183
It is redeeming to note that the sovereign and non-sovereign dichotomy in the State functions which the Supreme Court has followed so far, is no being narrowed down by a new gloss over the sovereign functions of the State The courts started holding most of the governmental functions as non-sovereign with a result that the area of tortious liability of the government expanded considerably.The Madhya Pradesh High Court (Associated Pool v. Radhabai, AIR 1976 MP 164.) Has put up the entire legal position, which emerged from the analysis of the cases, in the following words:“These cases show that the traditional sovereign functions are the making of law, the administration of justice, the maintenance of order, the repression of crime, carrying on for war, the making of treaties of peace an other consequential functions, Whether this list be exhaustive or not, it is at least clear that the socio-economic and welfare activities undertaken by a modern state are not included in the traditional sovereign functions...DamagesIt may happen that a public servant may be negligent in the exercise of his duty. It may, however, be difficult to recover compensation from him. From the point of view of the aggrieved person, compensation is more important than punishment. Therefore, like all other employers the State must be made vicariously liable for the wrongful acts of its servantsThe Courts in India are now becoming conscious about increasing cases of excesses and negligence on the part of the administration resulting in the negation of the personal liberty. Hence they are coming forward with the pronouncements holding the Government liable for damages even in those cases where the plea of sovereign function could have negative the governmental liability. One such pronouncement came in the case of Rudal Shah v. State of Bihar. (AIR 1983 SC 1036) Here the petitioner was detained illegally in the prison for over fourteen years after his acquittal in a full dressed trail. The court awarded Rs. 30,000 as damages so the petitioner.In Bhim Singh v. State of J&K (AIR 1986 SC 494) where the petitioner, a member of legislative Assembly was arrested while he was on his way to Srinagar to attend Legislative Assembly in gross violation of his constitutional rights under Articles 21 and 22 (2) of the Constitution, the court awarded monetary compensation of Rs.50,000 by way of exemplary costs to the petitioner.Another landmark case namely, C.Ramkonda Reddy v. State, (AIR 1989) AP 235) has been decided by the Andhra Pradesh, in which State plea of sovereign Module – 1   184
function was turned down and damages were awarded despite its being a cases of exercise of sovereign function.In Saheli a Women’s Resource Center v. Commissioner of Police, Delhi, (AIR 1990 SC 513) where the death of nine years old boy took place on account of unwarranted atrocious beating and assault by a Police officer in New Delhi, the State Government was directed by the court to pay Rs. 75000 as compensation to the mother of victim.In Lucknow Development Authority v. M.K. Gupta, (1994 1 SCC 245) the Supreme Court has observed that where public servant by mal fide, oppressive and capricious acts in discharging official duty causes in justice, harassment and agony to common man and renders the State or its instrumentality liable to pay damages to the person aggrieved from public fund, the State or its instrumentality is duly bound to recover the amount of compensation so paid from the public servant concerned.The Court very correctly analyses the entire position of sovereign liability in India and observed:“The immunity peculiar to English system found its way in our system of governance through run of judgments rendered during British period, more particularly after 1858, even though the maxim lex non protest peccary that is the king can do no wrong had no place in ancient India or in medieval India as the king in both the periods subjected themselves to the rule of law and system of justice prevalent like the ordinary subjects of the States. According to Monu, it was the duty of the king to uphold the law and he was as much subject to the law as any other person. it was said by Brihaspati, where a servant commissioned by his master does an improper, for the benefit of his master, the latter shall be held responsible for it. Even during the Muslim rule the fundamental concept under Muslim law like Hindu law was that the authority of king was subordinate to that of the laws. It was no different during British rule. The courts leaned in favor of holding the State responsible for the negligence of its officers.”Liability of the Public ServantLiability of the State must be distinguished from the liability of the individual officers of the State. So far as the liability of the individual officers is concerned, if they have acted outside the scope of their powers or have acted illegally, they are liable to the same extent as any other private citizen would be. The ordinary law of contact or torts or criminal law governs that liability. An officer acting in discharge of his duty without bias or mal fides could not be Module – 1   185
held personally liable for the loss caused to the other person However such acts have to be done in pursuance of his official duty and they must not be ultra vires his powers. If an official acts outside the scope of his powers, he should be liable in civil law to the same extent as a private individual would be. Where a public servant is required to be protected for acts done in the course of his duty, special statutory provisions are made for protecting them from liability.Public AccountabilityMajor developments in the area of public accountability have taken place. In the absence of public accountability today, corruption is a low-risk and high- profit business. The Classical observation of the Supreme Court in D.D.A v. Skipper Constructions ((1996) 4 SCC 622) deserves special attention. The court observed.“Some persons in the upper strata (which means the rich and the influential class of the society) have made the ‘property career’ the sole aim of their life. The means have become irrelevant in a land where its greatest son born in this country said “means are more important than the ends.” A sense of bravado prevails; everything can be managed; every authority and every institution can be managed  They have developed utter disregard for law may, contempt for it;In order to strengthen the concept of public accountability the court in Common Cause., A Registered Society (Petrol Pumps Matter) v. Union of India ((1996) 6 SCC 530) held that it is high time that public servants should be held personally liable for their functions as public servants.Thus, for abusing the process of court public servant was held responsible and liable to pay the cost out of his own pocket. ( Shori Lal v. DDA 1995 Supp (2) SCC119)The principle thus developed is that a public servant dealing with public property in oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional manner would be liable to pay exemplary damages as compensation to the government, which is ‘by the people’In Lucknow Development Authority v M. K. Gupta, (1994 1 SCC 243) the Court asked as to who should pay the compensation for the harassment and agony to the victim? For acts and omissions causing loss or injury to the subject, the public authority must compensate. Where, however, the suffering was due to mal fide or capricious act of public servant, such a public servant would be made to pay for it. Although the Court spoke in connection with the Consumer Protection Act, if this principle is to be extended to liability for wrongful acts in general, it would doubtless provide an effective deterrent against mal fide and capricious acts of public servants. RM Sahai J observed.   Module – 1 186
“The administrative law of accountability of public authorities for their arbitrary and even ultra vires actions has taken many strides. It is now accepted both by this Court and English courts that the State is liable to compensate for loss or injury suffered by a citizen die to arbitrary actions of its employees.”Having stated this, the learned Judge stopped to consider who would pay such compensation. Such compensation would of course be paid from the public treasury, which would burden the taxpayer. He, therefore further ordered that when a complaint was entitled to compensation, because of the suffering caused by a mal fide or oppressive or capricious act of a public servant, the Commission under the Consumer Protection Act should direct the department concerned to pay such compensation from the public fund immediately but to recover the same from those who are responsible for such unpardonable behavior by dividing it proportionately among them when they were more than one.Where a married woman was detained on the pretext of her being a victim of abduction and rape, and the police officers threatened her and commanded her to implicate her husband and his family in a case of abduction and forcible marriage, the Court directed the State government to launch prosecution against the police officers concerned and to pay compensation to the woman and her family members who were tortured.Where high ranking officials of a public authority, the Delhi Development Authority were held guilty of irregularities such as giving possession of lands sold in auction to the respondent bidder before receiving the auction amount in full, thus causing loss to the public and the guilt was established in an inquiry conducted by Justice (retired) O Chinappa Reddy, the Supreme Court directed the government to hold a departmental enquiry against such official. Where indiscriminate admissions were given in an educational institution in branch of eligible conditions, the Court ordered the government to take penal action against the person responsible for such admission. The head of the department is accountable to the court for carrying out he orders of the court. Personal costs may be awarded against the officer who fails to act in compliance with the court’s order.In recent years, the Supreme Court has also imposed personal fines and liabilities on ministers who used their discretionary powers on ulterior considerations. Where a minister allotted petrol pumps to his favorites or where a minister gave out of turn allotment of houses to persons related to her or known to her in preference to those who deserved such accommodation. The Court not only quashed the allotments but also imposed exemplary damages for having denied that largesse to the deserving people. Personal liability for abuse of power is a recent phenomenonThe Court further observed:  Module – 1 187
“In modern sense the distinction between sovereign and non-sovereign power does not exist. It all depends on the nature of power and manner of its exercise. Legislative supremacy under the Constitution arises out of Constitutional provisions. Similarly the executive is free to implement and administer the law. One of the tests to determine if the legislative or executive functions sovereign in nature is whether the State is answerable for such actions in courts of law, for instance, acts such as defense of the country, raising armed forces and maintain it, making peace or war, foreign-affairs, power external sovereignty and are political in nature. Therefore, they are not amenable to the jurisdiction of ordinary civil court. The State is immune from being sued as the jurisdiction of the courts in such matters is impliedly barred.”But there the immunity ends. No civilized system can permit an executive to play with the people of its country and claim that it is entitled to act in any manner, as it is sovereign. No legal or political system today can place the State above law, as it is unjust and unfair for a citizen to be deprived of his property illegally by the negligent act of officers of State. The modern social thinking and judicial approach is to do away with archaic State protection and place the State or the Government at par with other juristic legal entity. Any watertight compartmentalization of the functions of the State as sovereign or non-sovereign is not sound. It is contrary to modern jurisprudence. But with the conceptual change of statutory power being statutory duty for sake of society and the people, the claim of a common man cannot be thrown out merely because it was done by an officer of the State official and the rights of the citizen are require to be reconciled so that the rule of law in a welfare State is not shaken.It is unfortunate that no legislation has been enacted to lay down the law to torts in India. For that law, our courts have to draw from the English common law. Since the law of contract and the law of Sale of Goods and now the law of consumer protection have been enacted, it is high time that our Parliament enacts a law and thereby comes out of the legislative inertia.. The law in India on State liability has developed in the last two decades through judicial process. It has made the State liable for the torts of its servants. The courts have, however, developed such a law without expressly overruling some of the earlier decision, which defined the State liability in very narrow terms.While the State has enacted various anti-pollution laws and the laws for the protection of the consumers, which provide quick remedies to the citizens, there is yet no sincereModule – 1   188
and strict implementation of such laws. The industry has often shown inadequate regard fro provisions requiring installation of hazard preventing devices as required by the anti pollution laws. This became clear in MC Mehta v. Union of India. (AIR 1987 SC 1086) The State can be compelled to perform its statutory duties though a writ of mandamus, but will the State be liable to pay compensation to those who suffer because of its negligence or failure to obtain compliance of the industries to the provisions of the anti-pollution laws?In recent years, the courts have awarded compensation in a number of situations. Compensation was awarded for police brutalities committed on policemen People Union for Democratic Rights v. Police Commissioner((1989 ) 4 SCC 730 ) to victims of negligence by medical personnel in an eye camp resulting in irreversible damage to the eyes of patients, A.S Mittal v. State of U. P (AIR 1989 SC 1570) and to victims of road accidental President Union of India v. Sadashiv (AIR 1985 Bom 345) and to victims of environmental pollution (AIR 1987 Sc 1792) The plea of sovereign immunity has been rejected by courts time an again. Pushpinder Kaur v. Corporal Sharma (AIR 1985 P & H 81) Besides these, the courts have awarded excreta payment (Kali Dass v. State of J&K (1987) 1 SCC 430) and costs of public interest litigating to those who spearheaded it (DC Wadhwa v. State of Bihar ) The Supreme Court has held that where essential governmental functions were concerned, loss or injury occurring to any person due to failure of the government to discharge them would make it liable for compensation. Such compensation would be paid even if the plaintiff does not prove negligence on the part of an authority.In Nilbati Behera v. State of Orissa (AIR 1993 SC 1960) the Supreme Court held that the awards of compensation in the public law proceedings were different from the awards in the tort cases. In a civil suit for tortuous liability, whether the State was liable was an issue to be decided by taking evidence. The petitioner had to prove that the respondent was guilty of negligence and he suffered as a result of that. In a writ petition, the fact that a fundamental right had been violated was enough to entitle a person to compensation. Further, compensation in writ proceedings is symbolic and is not based on the quantification of the actual loss suffered by the petitioner.Under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, informal grievance redressal machinery has been provided. . Although consumer courts do not award damages for the civil wrongs, they have provided compensation to the consumer against unfair trade practice, deficient or negligent service or faulty goods. The consumer courts have not spared even government agencies. The Life Insurance Corporation, the nationalized banks, government hospitals have been made to pay compensation. Such actions of theModule – 1   189
consumer courts, however, do not deprive the consumer of his right to file a suit for tort in a civil court. Public Administration and Role of Civil Services in IndiaAdministrative capability is a major and crucial factor in the success or failure of development efforts. Administrative modernization has been increasingly recognized as an integral part of the development process. As the ability to assume new tasks, to cope with complexity, to solve novel problems, to modernize resources, etc., depends upon the administrative capacity based on increased professionalization, bureaucratization, modernization and administrative talent. This highlights the role of public and personnel administration.The quality of the institutions run by Government is dependent to a great extent upon the quality of the employees engaged in their operation.The efficient personnel administration can generate development, dynamism and modernization and ultimately lead to nation building through lubricating and optimizing the capacity and capability of personnel within the Government machinery.Module – 1   190
The functionaries in public administration can be categorized as “civil services” on the one hand and “public services” on the other. In the current literature on the subject:• • The term “civil service” denotes the entire group of personnel under the employment of governmental system only, mainly the central government and the state governments.The term “public service” is used for government employees, quasi-government employees, as well as employees of local bodies. The Civil Service personnel can be further categorized as follows:•  All operatives who work on the ground level have to directly interact with the common man for rendering a variety of services and performing regulatory functions They belong mostly to Group ‘D’ and partly to Group ‘C’ services and are known as the “cutting edge” of administration.•  The supervisory level and the middle executive level. They are a whole range of technical and non-technical personnel who belong to the Group ‘B’ services and shade into higher stages of Group “c” at the one end and the lower stages of Group ‘A’ at the other.•  Executive-cum-management levels constitute mostly Group ‘A’ service personnel comprising a whole range of non technical uni- functional services, scientific and technical services and the All India services. The top most layers of these services constitute the potential reservoir of policy makers and top management. Those moving into these policies and to management levels require training in policy analysis, policy formulation, strategic planning, evaluation etc.Functions of Civil Services Advice. One of the primary functions of civil service is to offer advice to the political executive. Ministers rely on the advice of their senior officials who are reservoirs of information and organized knowledge concerning the subject matters, which they administer. The political executive necessarily depends upon the civil personnel.Module – 1   191
For the information that he needs in formulating his own Programme. In the course of administration many problems arise which are usually worked out in the first instance by the civil service and the reported to the political overhead, if at all, for approval or merely for information.Programme and Operational Planning. In its broad sense planning is a responsibility of the political executive; planning the periodic adjustments of the revenue structure is a responsibility of the Minister for Finance. But there is a field wherein civil servants also Performa the function of planning, and this is the field of Programme planning. As we know the legislature passes (to draw a framework for the implementation of policy) an Act in general terms to execute and implement the policy for which certain rules and regulations are required. The civil servants, who put that law into execution, determine the specific steps to be taken in order to bring to fruition a policy or a law already agreed upon.Besides, assisting the ministers in the formulation of policy and drawing a framework of plan, the civil services are required to participate in the execution of plan. This is termed as operational planning.Production. Civil Service exists to perform services in the broadest sense of the term. Its primary purpose is production. Every official responsible for running administration needs work standards to enable him to determine whether his organization is reasonably effective, whether his subordinate employees are competent and whether levels of efficiency and output are rising or falling.Delegated Legislative Powers. Due to the emergence of the welfare state, the activities of the State have got multiplied. The Legislature is neither competent nor has the time to cope with enormous and complex legislation which has consequent grown up. Hence it delegates power of making law to the executive. It passes the bills in skeleton form bearing the details for the executive to fill. The permanent heads of the department evidently performs this job.Administrative Ad judicatory Power. This is another important power, which has been entrusted to the executive due to rapid technological developments and the emergence of the welfare concept of the State. Administrative adjudication means vesting judicial and quasi-judicial powers with and administrative department or agency. In India this power has been mostly given to the administrative heads.Public administration is the basic infrastructure that sustain as modern society. Therefore, the structure of civil administration and the competence of its higher civil servants have always been critical determinants in fueling vitality to drive the wheels of progress in any country.Role of Public Administration: Module – 1 192
Now let us try to find out the role of Public Administration in India. The postcolonial bureaucracy is in essence a progression from a system that evolved during a hundred and fifty years of British rule. With the constitutional transfer of power, the question of winding up the old system or even making radical changes immediately was not even considered.Adaptations, innovations, expansion and any basic changes were left to be made as altered conditions as new objectives emerged. The evolution of the bureaucracy during the last 50 years can be summed up as situational responses to emerging issues.Reforms in public administration were recognized and emphasized by the government in office from time to time.Notwithstanding its infirmities in normal functioning, the post colonial and post-independence bureaucracy has made a significant contribution to the country’s progress and has shown vitality and resilience in measuring up to virtually any kind of crisis.However, the following trends in process have brought into sharp focus the need for;The Constitution of India provides for recruitment and conditions for services of persons appointed to public services in the union or in the states through acts of appropriate legislature. Such acts comprehensively providing for among other disciplinary proceeding, duty to abide by the rule of law, obligation to serve wherever deployed and overall work ethics for all public servants were never passed.The expansion of the bureaucracy was done through a multitude of service rules and recruitment procedures, framed for each compartmentalized and segmented category of services.A clear-cut over arching and binding code of ethics encompassing the following essential elements is urgently required:     •  A revival of the public service ethics•  The modernization of its systems mindset and work culture, and•  Benchmarking its responsiveness to people’s needs.     •  Service in the government.•  Accountability to the public.•  Efficiently, effectiveness, professionalism and integrity, and•  Safeguarding public interest, among others. Module – 1 193
Such a code would provide the basic conditions, requirement, and style of work, discipline, and accountability for all public servants irrespective of the categories for service to which they belong. Several suggestions have been made for a character of ethics for public servants serving both at the Center and the State.The prevailing cultural values of consumerism, commercialism, and permissiveness and rights without duties aggravate the problem. Diminishing standards of morality in dealing with public services by the politicians are matters of grave concern, which reduce public trust in governance.Despite its is numerous achievements, the ever changing scenarios and agendas for Government, and the exploding consciousness and demands of the people have not always found public administrators ready with the right degree of motivation, professionalism, and devotion to work.Declining productivity in government is one of the principal reasons for the poor image of public services. This is because:The interface between the politician and the public servant:Accountability:Accountability is fundamental to any good public administration:     •  They are perceived as self-serving, impervious to the needs of the ordinary people, inefficient, unproductive, and unable to renew themselves.•  They suffer from over centralization, unhealthy inter service rivalries, and unprofessional and high cost management entities.     •  There are no incentives for higher output, as promotions are almost automatic.•  There is undue emphasis upon rules and procedures and not enough on output.     • •  Has become thoroughly dysfunctional.Political interference in the day to day running of theadministration has created havoc diluting both the achievements of proper results and accountability. Module – 1 194     
•  The Constitution for India with its basic values of democracy, social justice, rule of law, equality before the law, etc. provides a viable framework for developing accountability•  The thrust of a recent spate of Supreme Court judgments is that no minister or public servant can arrogate to himself/herself the poor to act in a manner which is arbitrary and that each public servant is responsible for injury to individual or loss to public property through any act of omission and commission.Experience of the past five decades indicates that:An effective balance is required in ensuring autonomy, accountability and transparency; the system has to reflect this balance. Public servants in India are accountable to a number of institutions. Prominent among these is:     •  Where departments and individual have not been vested with sufficient autonomy, the organization becomes non functional.•  Similarly, were autonomy has been granted without accountability and transparency, there has been misuse of resources and nepotism.         • • •  •  •  • Parliament/ State Legislatures and their Committees. Audit procedures and practice.The existing institutions/mechanisms of vigilance. The JudiciaryMass MediaThe Citizens, individually or through organizations of civil society.     In spite of these, a view persists that civil servants are accountable to no one. A number of recommendations have been made to improve these practices, the latest being those made by the Fifth Pay Commission.Service in public interest and the satisfaction of making an impact upon the society and the citizens have to be sustained through an appropriate work environment,. Incentive systems, job enrichment and softer special measures.Alexis De Tocqueville has stated that “when the inevitable is perceived to be no longer inevitable, it become intolerable.” This is true of public servants as well as the public at large in India. Module – 1 195
The interface between the political domain and the administrative domain which was clear, and properly maintained soon after independence, has increasingly become dysfunctional due to excessive political interference and following reasons: -• The processes commonly identified as politicization administration and criminalizatiion of politics have eroded time-honored virus of civil services, such as integrity, politics neutrality, courage and morale. Short term, targets, narrow horizons, and feudal outlook, purposeless activity contributes nothing to the welfare of the nation. Empty promises have seriously interfered with the management of personnel and public services.Therefore in view of aboveCompetent politics and renewed participatory administration paradigms are required to cope with the current situation and provide proper directions for future.A core of newer mindsets, styles, skills, and knowledge are imperative for all the actors in the administrative system.Training is an important segment of Personnel Management and can play a crucial role in the enhancement of capacity of individuals and organizations. Rapidly changing professional environment for civil services all over the world, reflecting explosive changes in the social, economic, and technological aspects of life have further added to the importance and need for an appropriate training policy and system.Prof. Yehezkil Dror, who acted as a UNDP Consultant on training of senior civil services in Indian, spelt out the following features as the core requirement of civil servants in the 21st Century:•  Professionalism: All civil servants, especially the senior ones, must be professionals’ in the sense of having knowledge in action, and possessing a trained capacity.this implies rejection of distinctions between experts and generalists as incorrect.•  Pluralism: No one set of characteristics which can be satisfied by any single human being can meet the aggregate requirement of the Civil Service. The multiplicity in backgrounds,. career Module – 1 196
patterns and also training is required, together with shared cores.•  Technical skills and languages; Basic tools needed by all civil servants include operating and advanced computerized workstation (and liking to do so.)•  Knowing the World and One’s Country: Good knowledge and understanding of the realities and dynamics of the world and of one’s country.•  Literacy in Basic Disciplines: All civil servants need literacy, though not advanced knowledge, in number of disciplines which are fundamental to governance in foreseeable future.•  Shared Domain of Professionalism: All civil servants should share significant professionalism, in two domain fundamental to their functions management, in a broad sense of that term, and advanced policy analysis.•  Interface Abilities: Productive interface with politicians group representatives, clients, expert, intellectuals, mass media staff, etc., is an essential feature of the civil service.•  Behavioral and Personality Features: Constant learning habits, including addiction to professional reading; capacities to exit oneself and to change ones mind; open mind and innovativeness. These are behavioral and personality features increasingly essential in a rapidly changing world.•  Value and Commitment: Value and commitment issues will be critical for the performance of governance in general and the senior civil service in particular.Several winds of change are sweeping the country, exercising pressure for dramatic reform in administrative procedures, challenging the capacities of administrators:Module – 1   197
A large number of social and activist groups have emerged all over the country demanding greater accountability of governmental functioning at all levels and for honest and efficient delivery of services.Voluntary organizations are at work in several fields actively mobilizing people for participatory decision-making and in exposing cases of dishonesty and corruption.Side by side with social activism targeted at the quality of governance, there is growing public awareness of the obligation of all concerned government authorities to protect and safeguard fundamental and human rights:•  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) set up in 1994, has already done outstanding work in exposing serious deficiencies which obtained in the application of the rule of law and preservation of human life, liberty and dignity. Over a period, the functioning of NHRC is bound to have a salutary effect on the functioning of various organizations and in this process, compel reform and prudent exercise of authority.•  Statutory powers and authority to supervise implementation of relevant policies and programmes are being demanded on the lines, of NHRC by several commissions set up to look after the specific interest of women, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, minorities, etc.Judicial intervention and activism is unavoidable whenever the functions of policy formulation and administrative are entwined mixed up, thereby diluting the responsibility, accountability and integrity:•  This is precisely what has been happening through orders passed by the Supreme Court in various public interest litigation cases in which allegation of misadministration and corruption were made against ministers and senior civil servants.•  Severe punishments awarded by the apex court in some of these cases should also result in cautioning all those who choose to exercise authority wantonly.•  While it may not be proper to expect the judiciary to bear the mantle of reforming the executive, judicial activism in glaring cases of default byModule – 1   198
public authorities is having a chastening effect.There has been large- scale expansion of the print and audiovisual media in recent years:•  A focused approach in dealing with major societal and political issues is gradually evolving in all forms of media.•  Indian journalism has made useful contribution by devoting adequate coverage of tasks well done, highlighting the achievements of honest and efficient public servants and organizations, and in giving special attention to developments in the remote and backward areas of our country.•  The mass media has also devoted greater attention to timely expose of cases and incidents involving irregular and unlawful exercise of authority and abuses of all kinds.Ongoing economic reform and structural changes in financial and industrial sectors together with their concomitant emphasis on social sectors and anti- poverty programs have evoked a new urgency to introduce reform in the administrative system.Streamlining procedures, revamping delivery systems and reorienting civil servants all over the country towards greater responsiveness and accountability are inescapable priorities now.The present context requires changes in models and procedures of administration based on cooperative federalism, decentralization, accountability, social justice, and respect for citizens, rights and transparency:•  The quality of life, especially in the rural are, depends upon proper infrastructure and delivery of the basic minimum needs upon which there is a widespread consensus in the country.•  The unfinished core of economic reform and the new model of participative governance would require the government to become more caring and responsive both to the needs of the growing economy and the concerns of the relatively unserved sections.Public administration and the civil services are passing through difficult times in terms of eroded credibility and effectiveness of the civil service and increasing criticism of the low level of honesty and transparency. In recognition of this need to take several corrective steps to improve the situation, the last two years witnessed wide discussions on this subject and the evolution of an Action Plan for Effective and Responsive Government.Module – 1   199
A Conference of Chief Secretaries was held in November 1996, on the agenda for these reforms, which was addressed by the Prime Minister. Following this Conference, a national debate was generated throughout the country to elicit reviews from a wide cross section of people. Retreats were organized in a number of leading academic and training institutions thought the country.An Action Plans for gearing up the Government machinery to provide a responsive, transparent and clean administration to the people and to address the issues of reform and morale in the civil services was proposed on the basis of widespread discussions and consultations. This action plan was discussed finally at a Conference of Chief Ministers in May 1997.This Conference was the culmination of the national debate on effective and responsive administration and provided impetus for determined action on restoration of the faith for the people in the fairness and responsiveness of the administration.The statement adopted at the end of this Conference Resolution provided a clear framework for reform and improvements in public administration throughout the country.The main directions of the action agreed upon at the Conference in the three areas are given below:(i) Accountable and Citizen-friendly Government: The following specific areas would be addressed:•  Citizen’sCharter: The central and state governments would formulate citizens’ charters for departments and offices, starting with those which have a large public interface:These citizens’ charters would specify standards of service and time limits that the public can reasonably expect avenues of grievance redressal and a provision for independent scrutiny with the involvement of citizen and consumer groups.These citizen’ charters would be widely publicized.•  Redressal of Public Grievance: All central and would:statedepartments Module – 1200
2.• Widely publicize facilities at various levels for the prompt and effective redressal of public grievances from the Secretariat downward to the village.Review the existing systems of redressal of public grievances, ad institute measures for streamlining them with a built-in system for independent monitoring.Review of laws, Regulations and Procedures: The Central and state governments would work together for the:Simplification of existing laws, regulation and procedures, repeal of obsolete laws.Reforms of laws operating against the weaker sections.Steps to reduce the time and cost of the disposal of cases in civil and criminal courts.Simplification for the entire process of cases of approvals, sanctions, and issue of permits by making it transparent and single-window- based. A priority agenda will be adopted and implemented for this purpose.People’s Participation, Decentralization and Devolution of powers: There was recognition of the need for greater decentralization and devolution of administrative powers at all levels. Consistent with the spirit of the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Constitution of India, immediate steps would be initiated by different state governments, with the involvement of the Central Government to strengthen people’s participation in government:Steps would be taken to ensure adequate devolution of powers and resources to the elected local bodies in rural and urban areas, in consonance with the recommendations of the State Finance Commissions.The Central and state governments would encourage and sustain people’s participation and dedicated voluntary agencies in all the schemes for the delivery of basic services.3. Transparency and Right to Information: Module – 1201
The Conference recognized that secrecy and lack of openness in transactions is largely responsible for corruption in official dealings and is also contrary to the spirit of an accountable dn democratic government:Steps would be taken to ensure easy access of the people to all information relating to government activities and divisions, except to the extent required to be excluded on specific grounds like national security.The Government of India would take immediate necessary steps, in consultation with state government, for examining the report of the Working Group on Right to Information, and for introducing in Parliament legislation for Freedom of Information, and amendments to the relevant provisions of the Official Secrets Act. 1923 and the Indian Evidence Act. While some of the States have already initiated steps to provide the Right to Information, others would also undertake a similar exercise.The Central and state governments would open computerized information and facilitation counters in all information and assistance is available to the pubic essential services and approvals.The ongoing efforts for systematic and phased computerization of governmental operations would be speeded up with the help of the National Informatics Centre. In this process, particular attention will be given to areas of computerization which provide significant benefit to the population such as land record, passports, investigation of offences, administration of justice, tax’s collection and administration, issue of permits and licenses, etc.It would also need to deal ruthlessly with the instances of nexus between politicians, civil servants and criminals.It was agreed that the politicization of the civil services would be curbed so as to minimize its impact not only on the morale and motivation of the services, but also on the sustained flow of responsive services to the public and efficient execution of schemes. Module – 1 202
The existing rules and legal provisions in central and state governments would be amended to enable the immediate and exemplary prosecution and removal of corrupt officials, and/or weeding out staff of doubtful integrity.A suitable mechanism would be evolved to reward government employees doing good work.Central and state governments with the provision of adequate staff, powers, resources and independence would strengthen the investigation agencies and vigilance machinery.The existing procedures for departmental enquiries and vigilance proceedings of government employees would be revamped on the basis of a study of detailed proposals worked out by the Government of India.The area of discretion available to various levels of administration would be reduced to the minimum, along with steps to prevent their arbitrary use.The role and powers of audit in the identification and pursuit of financial and procedural irregularities would be strengthened, and there will be close networking of various Agencies like Lok Ayukta, CBI, Vigilance Machinery, Income Tax Authorities, Enforcement Directorate, and CAG.The Conference appreciated the importance of encouraging and ensuring commitment of the employees of public services to ethical standards and basic principles of Constitution such as secularism, social justice, attention to the needs of weaker sections, rule of law, professionalism and integrity.The state governments would consider formulating and enforcing a Code of Ethics for State Services similar to the Draft Code being considered for introduction at the central level: Module – 1 203
•  It was recognized that frequent and arbitrary transfer of public servants affect the ability of the system to deliver services effectively to the people, and the implementation poverty alleviation schemes.•  It was agreed that institutional arrangements should be evolved for enabling objective and transparent decisions on postings, promotions and transfers of officials, particularly those working in key areas to ensure stability of tenure and de-politicized postings at all levels.For implementation arrangements in order to carry forward the action plan for immediate as well as long-term improvements in administration, it was decided to:•  Set up a Committee under the Cabinet Secretary including some of the Chief Secretaries representing different regions of the country as well as some senior officials of the Government of India in order to elaborate the different elements of the Action Plan in terms of operational content, and to work out the decisions required at central and state levels.•  The Committee would draw up a time bound agenda for legal and regulatory reform in priority areas including a statutory scheme for Freedom of Information.•  It would consider steps to secure widespread acceptance and feedback from different sections of the public, and elicit the cooperation of the people for a responsive administration.Future strategies for effective governance:The need of the time is to adhere to systematic and sustained efforts, for development of Indian democracy and Indian administration system and ensure that the government insists upon the following essential commitments for good governance. Module – 1   204

 IntroductionT his training package has been designed for the senior level Administrators/Officers of the Central Government and the State Governments with a purpose to meet the challenges and needs of the contemporary society. The State activism has led to the inevitable result of state assuming more and more powers to regulate society through its three organs-Legislature, Judiciary and Executive. While increase in State activities has meant increased work for all the organs, yet the largest extension in depth and range of functions and powers has taken place at the level of executive-cum-administrative organ. We have come to live in an administrative age and administrative organ has become predominant and is on the ascendancy, its functions and powers have grown vastly over time. Administration is the all-pervading feature of life today with the growth of the society, its complexity also increases and this presents new problems for the administration. In fact the modern state is regarded as the custodian of social welfare, and consequently there is not a single human activity, which is free from direct or indirect interference by the State. The growth in the range of responsibilities of state has thus ushered in anadministrative age and thereby need of Administrative Law.Administrative Law does not have a definite sphere of operation. Being entirely judge-made, unlike the laws relating to other subjects, such as crime, revenue, property and so on, administrative law by itself is not an independent subject of law. A question regarding application of the principles of administrative law may arise in the course of administration of any other branch of law. Though the precise content of administrative Module – 1 209
 law is not capable of a definition, it is well accepted that its operation is confined to the realm of public law. Broadly, branches of law, which deal with those rights, obligations, duties or privileges of public authorities inter se and their relationship with private individuals, pertain to public law. Thus, administrative law presents a classical example of judicial creativity and a high benchmark of judicial activism. This makes administrative law in India highly dynamic and perplexing at the same time worthwhile answering legitimate needs and aspirations of the people and provide an effective instrument in the hands of the people to combat governmental arbitrariness through the instrumentality of courts. It was born out of a desire on the part of judiciary to usher in a rule of law society by enforcing the norms of good governance and thus produced a rich wealth of legal norms and principles and added a new dimension to the discipline of administrative law in India.In recent times, there has been a phenomenal expansion of the horizons of administrative law. The pronouncements on the law of delegated legislation bear ample testimony to courts’ contribution. The liberal approach of the court in upholding the validity of both delegation of legislative powers and delegated legislation has absolved the legislature from performing their duty i.e. law making with all its essential attributes leading to expansion of the executive functioning and consequent enlargement of the jurisdiction of the courts by the process of judicial review.Administrative law deals with the delegated powers and procedures of non- legislative and non-judicial i.e. executive or administrative officials and agencies of Govt. and with Judicial review of their actions as they affect private interests. In other words Administrative law has developed not to sanctify executive arbitrariness but to check it and protect the rights of the people against the administrative excessesModule – 1   210
therefore the central theme of administrative law is also the reconciliation of liberty and power.Designed for: This package is designed for A, B, C level of the officers of the Central government and State government i.e. senior level and middle level officers of the government who are involved in executing the governmental policies to run the State.Need For Administrative Law Training It is the administrative organ of the State, which is the subject matter ofadministrative law. It is therefore essential that administrators/officials are well versed with the propounded principles of administrative law and therefore deliver effectively for good governance. It is in recognition of this fact that administrators need to enhance their administrative capabilities and thereby inculcate citizen-oriented attitudes as required. The most important component of this training is un doubtedly the changing of embedded perceptions and eliminate the misgivings about the subject matter.There is a need to develop both human and modern technology to improve efficiency. However priority should be given to human development. The organizations had usually been more sensitive to possibilities offered to them by achievement of modern technology rather than to the refinements of human behavior. We know that growth in science and technology in the present century has led to great structural changes and the aspiration of the people as to Quality of life has arisen. The socio-eco-politico multi -dimensional problems that the people face due to technological development cannot be solved except the growth of administration andModule – 1   211

In the era of rapid change, the improvement of management in its human aspect has become critical issue. Learning is an ongoing and perpetual process, which leads to the performance enhancement of the officers and the development of the organization. Keeping in view the needs of the administrators the inputs to be given in the form of knowledge skills and attitudes may be as under:1. Knowledge ofThe concept of administrative law and its relevance in the present day governance.The constitutional provisions the importance of role of state and safeguarding public interest.The developmental strategies and principles evolved by the courts like the doctrine of promissory estoppel, doctrine of legitimate expectations and doctrine of public accountability.The anatomy of administrative power and its functions with special reference to delegated legislation.

 CASE-STUDIES ON NATURAL JUSTICEOver the years by a process of judicial interpretation two rules have been evolved as representing the principles of natural justice in judicial process, including therein quasi-judicial and administrative processes. They constitute the basic elements of a fair hearing having their roots in the innate sense of man for fair play and justice which is not that preserve of any particular race or country but is shared in common by all men.Natural justice occupies an area of crucial significance and great relevance to the Administrators. All the administrators are not very clear about the concept of natural justice. Some of them appear to be under the impression that the principles of natural justice are not applicable to administrative proceedings. A few administrators seem   Module – 1 248 
to believe that natural justice is an obstacle to effective and expeditious performance of administrative functions.It is in this background that the following two case studies have been drawn up on the basis of two important cases decided by the Supreme Court of India. By and large, they cover the entire gamut of Natural Justice and capture theemerging trends. Infact these two cases are the Trend Setters. These case studies have been designed for trainee officers with the following objectives:•  To clarify the concept of natural justice;•  To explain to the trainee officers the new trends and emergingdimensions of natural justice;•  To assist them in solving complicated questions of Law andfact involving natural justice; and•  To identify the need upon the trainees that observance ofnatural justice adds to the quality of decision-making and enhances the credibility of the system.These two case studies have been specially selected, for they are possessed of immense potential to equip the trainees with the requisite knowledge and skill and also with values and attitudes, so that while administering and applying Law in any proceeding or inquiry or investigation, they ensure vindication of justice by adopting a procedure which is just, fair and reasonable. Further, the principles of natural justice are neither codified nor embodied and as such, all of them should not and need not be indiscriminately and mechanically adopted in each and every case without regard to the complex realities, because unnatural expansion of Natural Justice may result in failure of justice.Module – 1   249
 Case No. 1Reference: A.K. Kraipak and others (Petitioners) VsUnion of India and others (Respondent)Citation: AIR 1970 S.C. 150.When the Constitution of India came into force (the 26 January, 1950), there were two All India Services, namely IAS and IPS in existence. Later on, another All India Service, know as IFS, was brought into being (1966).Naturally, the question of recruitment to the newly formed Indian Forest Service came up. Rules and Regulations were framed to provide for recruitment. Mention may be made of Indian Forest Service (Recruitment) Rules. 1966 and Indian Forest Service (Initial Recruitment) Regulations, 1966. It was laid down that the Central Government would recruit to the IFS from amongst the members of the State Forest Services who might be adjudged suitable. Fore the Module – 1   250
purpose of selection, special selection Boards would be constituted for different areas. The Boars would prepare lists of suitable officers and forward them to the Central Government. The lists would, thereafter, be referred to the Union Public Service Commission by the Central Government along with the records of the Officers included in the list and also of other eligible officers of the State Forest Services not included in the List. The Union Public Service Commission would then, after proper evaluation, make such recommendations to the Central Government as it might deem fit. The officers recommended by the Commission would be appointed to the IFS subject to the availability of vacancy in the State Cadre concerned.  This was the background. One such special Selection Board was constituted for the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The Board consisted of the following members: -(i) Shri M.A. Venkataraman, the nominee of the Chairman, UPSC(ii) Inspector-General of Forests, Govt. of India.(iii) Chief Secretary to the Govt. of India.(iv) One Joint Secretary to the Govt. of India.(v) Shri Naquishbund, the Acting Chief Conservator of Forests, Jammu and Kashmir.The Board met at Srinagar in May 1967. No interview as conducted. The Board consulted the relevant records and selected 25 officers in the first instance. Subsequently, the Board added more names to the List of persons already selected. The Union Public Service Comission eventually accepted the final list, thus prepared by the Board. That list was then published.It was that List that turned out to be a bone of contention and became the subject of litigation. The name of Shri Naquishbund appeared at the top of List. He had been promoted to the post of Chief Conservator of Forests inModule – 1 251
1964. He was not yet confirmed in that post. There were officers, namely G. H. Basu, M. I. Baig and A. K. Kaul, who claimed that they were senior to him. Basu and Kaul had appealed to the post of Chief Conservator of Forests. The appeal of Basu was still pending when the aforesaid List was made.In that final List, the names of Basu, Baig and Kaul did not find any place. They felt very much aggrieved at their exclusion. Some other eligible officers including A. K. Kraipak also became extremely unhappy because they were also not se4lected. Some of them were serving as Conservators of Forests  and Divisional Forest Officers. They filed potions before the Supreme Court of India, challenging the validity of that list. They attacked it on various grounds but for the purpose of this case study, reference would be made to the material contentions raised on behalf of the petitioners. Eminent advocates like Mr. A. K. Sen, Mr. Frank Anthony and Mr. C. K. Daphtary appeared for the petitioners.The thrust of the arguments advocated on behalf of the petitioners was that the selections, as reflected in the aforesaid list, were vitiated y gross violation of the principles of Natural Justice.They contended that Naquishbund himself was a candidate for being considered in the context of such selection Board. His membership of the Board and participation in the process of selection introduced personal bias and militated against the Natural Justice, resulting in gross failure of Justice. The principle of Natural Justice on which they relied was that a person should not be a Judge in his own cause.Module – 1 252
It was also argued that the List in question was liable to be quashed on account of subversion of Natural Justice, arising out of personal bias of a member of the Selection Board.The petitions were opposed by the Respondents, which included the Union of India. Mr represented the Union of India. Niren De. Attorney General of India. The case of the contenting Respondents was that the power given to and exercised by the Selection Board was a purely administrative power, because its duty was merely to select officers, who in its opinion were suitable for being absorbed into the Indian Forest Service.The Respondents pointed out that Mr. Naquishbund wholly withdrew himself from the deliberation of the Board when his case came up before it for  Module – 1253consideration. He, therefore, did not take any part whatsoever in any discussion involving him and did not a in any manner influence the decision of the other members.The points sought to be made out by the Respondents may be formulated as follows:-(a) (b)(c)The principles of Natural Justice do not apply to proceedings before Administrative Authorities.The withdrawal of and the consequent non-involvement of Naquishbund left no scope for holding that he acted as the Judge in his own cause.The Selection Board was a mere recommendatory body and ultimate appointment depended upon the decision of the Govt. of India taken in consultation with the UPSC. Hence, the List prepared by the Selection Board was not vulnerable to be called into question, as it was not final.
(d) In any event, all the selections made by that Board cold not be vitiated. The cases of Basu, Baig and Kaul might however, be reviewed, if considered necessary.Upon the pleadings of the parties and the rival contentions they raised before the Supreme Court, the points that fell for determination may be expressed as follows:-(i) What is meant by “Natural Justice”(ii) What are the basic principles of Natural Justice?(iii) Do they apply to proceedings of administrative/executivenature?(iv) Is there any distinction between quasi-judicial andadministrative powers from the angle of applicability of the principles of Natural Justice?  (v) (vi)(vii)(viii)(ix) (x)Was it really necessary to find out whether or not Naquishbund had actually been biased?Was real likelihood of bias or even reasonable suspicion of bias sufficient to disqualify a person from deciding anything to the prejudice of anybody?Did the facts of the case attract the operation of the principle “a person should not be the Judge in his own cause.”Was there any violation of Natural Justice in the case under consideration?If so, were all the selections made by the Board bad?Was the entire list prepared by the Selection Board liable to be quashed?Module – 1254
 Case No.IIReference: Maneka Gandhi (Petitioner)vsUnion of India and another (Respondents)Citation : AIR 1978 SC 597.Smt. Maneka Gandhi had a passport for going abroad. It was issued to her on Ist June 1976 under the Passports Act, 1967. Module – 1 255 
On 4th July, 1977, she received a letter from the Regional Passport Officer, Delhi. That letter conveyed to her the decision of the Government of India to impound her passport and called upon her to surrender the same within seven days. No reason was, however, assigned in support of the decision to impound the passport. What was disclosed is that it was done in public interest.She wrote back to the passport officer demanding a copy of the statement of reasons as provided for under Section 10(5) of that Act. A reply came, not from the passport officer, but from the Minister of External Affairs, Govt. of India, on 6th July, 1977. The Government declined to furnish reasons fro what was described as “in the interest of the general public”.Thereupon, she filed a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India before the Supreme Court. She challenged the action of the Government in impounding her passport and declining to give reasons for doing so.  The union of India resisted her petition. A counter-affidavit was filed in Court on behalf of the Government in answer to the writ petition. It was divulged there that the petitioner’s passport was impounded because her presence in India was likely to be required in connection with proceedings before a Commission of Inquiry.The challenge made by the petitioner was founded, among other things, upon the following grounds:-(a) Section 10(3 (a) of the Passport Act, which authorized the Passport Authority to impound a passport, was violative of the equality clause contained in Article 14 of the Constitution of India, because it conferred vague and undefined power.Module – 1256
(b) Her passport could not be impounded without giving her an opportunity of being heard in defense. The order was made in contravention of the rule of Natural Justice embodied in the maxim “Audi alter am Partem”. Hence, the order of impounding was null an void.(c) If sec. 10 (3) were read in such a manner as to exclude the right of hearing, then it would be invalid on account of arbitrariness.(d) Section 10(3) © also offended against Article 21 of the Constitution of India, since it did not prescribe any procedure within the meaning of that Article. Even if it was assumed that Section 10 (3) © prescribed a procedure, it was wholly arbitrary, unreasonable and unjust and therefore, not in compliance with the requirement of that Article.On behalf of the Union of India, it was submitted that the order impounding the passport of the petitioner was perfectly justified and that the petition was without merits and ought to be dismissed. In the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the government of India, the various allegations made in the petition weredenied.It was contended that there was apprehension that the petitioner was attempting or was likely to attempt to leave the country and thereby hamper the functioning of the Commission of Inquiry.It was urged on behalf of the govt. of India that having regard to the nature of the action involved in the impounding of a passport, the “audi alteram partem: rule must be held to be excluded, because if notice were to be given to the holder of a passport and reasonable opportunity afforded to him/her to show cause, he/She might, immediately, on the strength of the passport, make good his/her exit from the country and thereby frustrate the very object of impounding. Module – 1   257
Ultimately, the Attorney General informed the Court that the government of India was willing to hear the petitioner in respect of impounding of her passport. The premise was to give what might be described as “post-decisional hearing” and either to cancel or to confirm the order of impounding according to the results of such hearing.In the circumstances, the Supreme Court, by a majority, did not think it necessary to formally interfere with the impugned order. The Supreme Court, however, gave its anxious consideration to the issues of law involved in that case an expressed its opinions thereon.The important legal issues that came up for decision may be outlined as follows:(i) Should the rule of “audi alterm partem” be read into a statute, which authorizes an administrative body to decide to the prejudice of a person but does not expressly provide for a prior hearing to be given to the person likely to be affected by such decision?  (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (vi)Can a post-decisional hearing adequately compensate absence of hering before taking of decision?Is mere prescription of some kind of procedure enough to comply with the requirements of Article 21 of the Constitution of India?Should the “Law”, as contemplated in Article 21 embody the principles of natural justice?Has the Supreme Court of India injected into Article 21 the American concept of due process of law?Should a procedure be “just” fair and reasonable in order to fulfill the demand of Article21?Module – 1258
(vii) Is it incumbent upon an administrative authority to observe the principles of Natural Justice?(viii) Are the principles of Natural Justice embodied or written rules?(ix) (x)Are they amenable to situational variations?What are the effects of breach of Natural Justice committed by an administrative authority?Will you kindly determine these points of Law?
